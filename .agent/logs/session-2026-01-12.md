# Session Log: 2026-01-12

## Summary
Implemented three rounds of structural feedback to strengthen the book's through-line.

## Round 1: High-Margin Feedback
- [x] Table placement fix (Ch 8) — added `float` package, `[H]`
- [x] Reclassification triggers (Ch 9/10 planning notes)
- [x] Part III audit outputs — Ch 9 table format, Ch 10 prose format
- [x] Drafting guidance (structural-feedback-actions.md)

## Round 2: Coherence + Running Thread
- [x] Deitality early-use fixed — Ch 4 introduces with gloss, Ch 8 footnote simplified
- [x] Fat-class vs interest-relativity clarified (Ch 8)
- [x] Running thread: Definiteness (Chs 4–8) with `\textsc{Definiteness thread.}` label

## Round 3: Evidential Grounding + Discipline
- [x] Ch 4: Added citations to mechanism examples (pickering2004, mintz2003, kirby2008)
- [x] Ch 4: Added overlap clause (divergent falsifiers, not overlapping extensions)
- [x] Ch 10: Disciplined LLM stress test (added success criteria + non-LLM alternative)
- [x] Style guide: Added "Running Threads" section

## Decisions Made
- **Term consistency**: "HPC-kind" in titles, "HPC kind" in prose (verified correct, no fix needed)
- **Running thread format**: `\textsc{Term thread.}` small-caps run-in (Bringhurst option 3)
- **LLM predictions**: Kept as probe but disciplined with success criteria; added acquisition-based alternative

## Files Changed

### Chapters
- `chapter04.tex` — HPC≠NK section, deitality intro with gloss, running thread, citations, overlap clause
- `chapter05.tex` — running thread
- `chapter06.tex` — running thread
- `chapter07.tex` — running thread
- `chapter08.tex` — audit table, fat-class fix, interest-relativity clause, running thread
- `chapter09.tex` — audit output section (table format)
- `chapter10.tex` — audit output section (prose format), stress tests disciplined

### Infrastructure
- `.house-style/preamble.tex` — float package
- `.house-style/style-guide.md` — running threads section
- `notes/chapter09_planning.md` — reclassification trigger
- `notes/chapter10-grist.md` — reclassification trigger
- `notes/structural-feedback-actions.md` — drafting guidance

## Commits (restructure-part-1 branch)
- 1a62ca0: High-margin structural feedback implementation
- 5fde818: Round 2 (deitality, fat-class, running thread)
- 625e086: Running thread typography
- bc01ebd: Round 3 evidential grounding

## Tag
- **v0.3-restructure**: Part II structural revisions complete

## Next Steps
1. Create GitHub Release at v0.3-restructure with PDF attachment (manual step)
2. Compare Ch 9 (table) vs Ch 10 (prose) audit formats in PDF — decide preference
3. Ch 11 drafting using audit-first approach
