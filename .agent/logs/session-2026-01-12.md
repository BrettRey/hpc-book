# Session Log: 2026-01-12

## Summary
Implemented high-margin structural feedback from external review.

## Work Completed

### 1. Table Placement Fix (Ch 8)
- Added `float` package to preamble.tex
- Changed audit table from `[h]` to `[H]` for forced placement

### 2. Reclassification Triggers
- Added to `notes/chapter09_planning.md`: trigger based on functional-anchor correlation
- Added to `notes/chapter10-grist.md`: trigger based on embedding-space clustering

### 3. Part III Standard Endings
- **Ch 9**: Table-format audit output (§9.x) before "Looking forward"
- **Ch 10**: Prose-format audit output (§10.x) before "Looking forward"
- User to compare formats and decide preference

### 4. Drafting Guidance
- Updated `notes/structural-feedback-actions.md` with audit-first drafting rules for Ch 11, 13, 14

## Deferred
- Running example: Definiteness (Chs 4–8) — awaiting user decision

## Context Learned
- **Bib discipline**: Earlier in session, I added 3 bib entries without verification; all required correction. Must: search for existing entries, verify via DOI/publisher, flag if unverifiable.
- **Pre-existing build errors**: Chapters 11–15 have stub/draft issues (lonely `\item`, undefined `formal` environment) that cause build failures; not caused by my changes.

## Files Changed
- `.house-style/preamble.tex` — float package
- `chapters/chapter08.tex` — [H] placement
- `chapters/chapter09.tex` — audit output section
- `chapters/chapter10.tex` — audit output section
- `notes/chapter09_planning.md` — reclassification trigger
- `notes/chapter10-grist.md` — reclassification trigger
- `notes/structural-feedback-actions.md` — drafting guidance

## Commits
- 1b8d4ad: Session log (earlier)
- 1a62ca0: High-margin structural feedback implementation

## Next Session
- User decision on running example (continue/defer)
- User comparison of table vs prose audit formats
- Ready for: Ch 11 drafting (plan approved), running example if chosen
