# Session Log: 2026-01-12

## Summary
Implemented structural feedback action plan from `notes/structural-feedback-actions.md`.

## Decisions Made
- **HPC ≠ NK section** added to Ch 4 (§4.4) — addresses Magnus, Lipski, Craver objections; includes decision rule for audit template
- **HPC-kind audit template** added to Ch 8 (§8.6) — 7-step table, cross-references Ch 4 decision rule
- **Predictions subsection format** added to Ch 9/10 planning notes — discriminating predictions required
- **Running example updates** (definiteness across Chs 4–8) deferred to revision pass

## Context Learned
- **Bib discipline failure**: I added 3 bib entries (magnus, onishi, lipski) without verifying details — all required correction. Must: (1) search bib for existing entries first, (2) verify via DOI/publisher before adding, (3) if unverifiable, flag explicitly.
- User corrected: magnus2012 → magnus2014, lipski author name (Joachim), onishi was duplicate

## Files Changed
- `chapters/chapter04.tex` — new §4.4 "HPC kinds are not natural kinds"
- `chapters/chapter08.tex` — new §8.6 "The HPC-kind audit"
- `references.bib` — magnus2014, lipski2020 (corrected by user)
- `notes/chapter09_planning.md` — added §9.8 Predictions
- `notes/chapter10-grist.md` — added §10.7 Predictions
- `notes/term-ledger.md` — created (simplified version)
- `notes/structural-feedback-actions.md` — created

## Commits
- 53fbd86: Notes: tightened structural feedback plan + term ledger
- 1cde50f: Ch 4, 8: HPC≠NK section + audit template
- 0d17aef: Notes: Predictions subsection format added to Ch 9/10 plans
- 3248402: Ch 4, 8, bib: Style edits + citation fixes

## Next Session
- **Remaining from action plan**: Running example updates (Chs 4–8) — low priority, deferred to revision pass
- **Ready for**: Chapter drafting (Ch 9 Countability has full planning doc)
- **Watch**: Bib entries — verify before adding
