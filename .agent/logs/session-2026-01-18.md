# Session Log: 2026-01-18

## Focus
Ch 15 planning ideas (methodological consequences, mereology integration, peroration).

## Decisions Made
- Keep suggestions as a menu of options rather than a single canonical answer per question.
- Anchor the mereology material in typed parthood + intensional mereology.
- Close Ch 15 by returning explicitly to Huddleston’s \enquote{otherwise} email.

## Context Learned
- The user prefers broad ideation here, not definitive positions.

## State Changes
- PROJECT_LOG.md
- .agent/logs/session-2026-01-18.md

## Open Questions
- Which subset of methodological consequences should become prose in Chapter 15?
- Where should the mereology block sit (inside \S\ref{sec:15:overlap} or as its own section)?
- Which peroration shape best matches the final chapter tone?

## Next Session
- If requested, draft the Ch 15 section text in `chapters/chapter15.tex` and integrate mereology language from `papers/linguistics-mereology/main.tex`.
