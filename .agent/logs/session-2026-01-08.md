## Afternoon Session (this session)

### Key Decisions & Noteworthy Changes

**Theoretical refinements:**
- Demonstratives (*this*/*that*) reanalyzed as **constructionally-conditioned** rather than simply gender-neutral: neutral in specificational *be* and ellipsis contexts; non-personal in bare fused-head function. Added §12.6.5 and Table 12.1 footnote.
- Added comparison of English referential coherence to French morphosyntactic coherence (§12.5.1) — same maintenance function operating at different levels.
- Added capstone sentence: "This coupling is the category we recognize as English gender."

**Terminology consistency with Chapter 5:**
- Fixed "graded membership" → "instability at the edges" and "graded boundaries" → "boundary cases" — Chapter 5 argues boundaries are sharp; what's graded is typicality/stability, not membership.

**Mechanism humility:**
- Softened claims in §12.5.3: "at least three domain-specific channels are visible" (not a closed list); concluded with "the point is not to close the list but to show that the coupling is actively maintained."

**Alignment examples:**
- Added singular-they example showing reverse pressure (resistance to innovation vs. enforcement of error). Illustrates generational norm conflict.

**Future predictions:**
- Added note that *it* for infants may wane as singular *they* spreads.

**Number/gender interface:**
- Added *much* observation: strictly non-personal, but may follow from count/mass semantics (persons are individuated) rather than independent gender constraint. Case where two mechanisms align.

**Formatting:**
- Standardized `\ungram{}` markers throughout (replaced `\textsuperscript{*}`)
- Fixed `\hfill` positions (inside closing braces)

### Chapter 5 Fixes
- Fixed undefined reference `sec:5:testing-stability` → `subsec:5:multi-category`
- Removed non-existent `fig:iterated-learning` reference

## Morning Session

### House Style Enforcement (commit 9b24548)

**Spelling (Oxford/UK):**
- `defense` → `defence`
- `standardisation` → `standardization`
- `judgments` → `judgements`

**Dashes:**
- Em-dashes (`---`) → spaced en-dashes (`~--`)

**Formatting:**
- `\textbf{}` → `\emph{}` for emphasis within `\mention{}`
- Manual quotes → `\enquote{}`

**Contractions (8 total):**
- Expanded throughout per house style
