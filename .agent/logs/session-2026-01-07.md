## Chapter 12: Pro-form Gender Revisions

### Morning Session (~08:30–09:30)

**Completed:**
- Fixed TikZ tree for Figure 12.1 (replaced tabular layout)
- Reordered tree and table to match: non-personal → personal; general → temporal → locative
- Added `we`/`you` pronouns and determinatives to Table 12.1 with subscript note
- Fixed Spanish gloss alignment (each word tagged individually with `\mention{}`)
- Changed Spanish judgment from `[?]` to `[*]`
- Added `huddleston2005` (SGSWE) bib entry
- Ran biber to resolve `bjorkman2017`, `konnellycowper2020` citations
- Updated terminology: "morphosyntactic" → "lexico-grammatical" for pro-form inventory
- Added footnote acknowledging CGEL/Quirk treat who/which as separate axis from gender

**Preamble changes:**
- `\marg{}` and `\mmark{}` now produce superscript `?`
- Added `\mmmark{}` for superscript `??`
- Converted all `\ex[?]{}` to `\ex[]{\mmark{}}` pattern in Ch 12

**In progress:**
- Checking blank lines after `\end{exe}` — remove where text continues paragraph
