## Chapter 12: Pro-form Gender Revisions

### Morning Session (~08:30–09:30)

**Completed:**
- Fixed TikZ tree for Figure 12.1 (replaced tabular layout)
- Reordered tree and table to match: non-personal → personal; general → temporal → locative
- Added `we`/`you` pronouns and determinatives to Table 12.1 with subscript note
- Fixed Spanish gloss alignment (each word tagged individually with `\mention{}`)
- Changed Spanish judgment from `[?]` to `[*]`
- Added `huddleston2005` (SGSWE) bib entry
- Ran biber to resolve `bjorkman2017`, `konnellycowper2020` citations
- Updated terminology: "morphosyntactic" → "lexico-grammatical" for pro-form inventory
- Added footnote acknowledging CGEL/Quirk treat who/which as separate axis from gender

**Preamble changes:**
- `\marg{}` and `\mmark{}` now produce superscript `?`
- Added `\mmmark{}` for superscript `??`
- Converted all `\ex[?]{}` to `\ex[]{\mmark{}}` pattern in Ch 12

**In progress:**
- Checking blank lines after `\end{exe}` — remove where text continues paragraph

### Commits pushed to `restructure-part-1`:
- `68ece5f` — TikZ tree, table updates, order consistency, huddleston2005
- `ea0f686` — Spanish gloss alignment fix
- `90ce9e7` — Superscript judgment markers

### Afternoon Session (~11:00–12:00)

**Resolved Issues:**
- **Fatal `xelatex` Crash:** Fixed `\ea` / `\ex` syntax in `chapter12.tex` (enclosed optional arguments in braces).
- **BibTeX Conflicts:** Removed duplicate entries for `kirby2014`, `pickeringgarrod2004`. Resolved `cuneogoldberg2023` case mismatch by fixing citation in `chapter03.tex` and cleaning up `references.bib`.
- **Glossary Generation:** Ran `makeglossaries` to generate `hpc-book.gls`. Confirmed page count increase (284 → 324).
- **Index Generation:** Manually ran `makeindex` for `subject`, `names`, `lexical`. Confirmed page count increase (324 → 329).
- **Save Conflict:** Resolved editor-vs-disk conflict in `chapter12.tex` by reverting to the corrected disk version.

**Current State:**
- **Build Status:** Success (Exit Code 0).
- **Page Count:** 329 pages (including Frontmatter, Chapters 1-15, Glossary, Indices).
- **Citations:** Stabilized (no undefined citations or warnings).

### Evening Session (~14:00–21:00)

**Major Chapter 12 Expansion:**
- Added categorical/graded distinction in opening
- Expanded personhood construal (default vs locally imposed)
- Rewrote maintenance section with cognitive grounding, semantic transparency, alignment
- Added "What the HPC framing buys" section
- Added "The maintenance spectrum" comparing English/French/German
- Added note on *that*/bare relatives as avoidance
- Restored subsubsection headings in slippage section with labels

**New Citations Added:**
- Corbett 1991, Dahl 2000, Audring 2009, Bock 2006

**CGEL Refinements:**
- 'stands for' paragraph replaced with CGEL-compatible version
- 'personal pronoun who' → 'personal interrogative pro-form who'
- 'determinative' → 'determiner function' in table note
- Interrogative 'who' as open slot with personhood constraint
- Spanish example softened from * to ??

**Prose refinements:**
- "Same dog; same tail"
- "teeth... mostly for display"
- "the system's great solvent" (plural *they*)
- "interactionally loud"

**Commits pushed to `restructure-part-1`:**
- `9370061` — Major Ch 12 expansion
- `9f6d8d7` — Prose refinements + Bock 2006
- `4176b9f` — LaTeX escaping fix
- `92725ec` — Add missing labels to 4 subsubsections

**Current State:**
- **Build Status:** Success (latexmk)
- **Page Count:** 330 pages
- **Output:** `build/hpc-book.pdf`

### Late Evening Session (~21:20)

**Final Chapter 12 Refinements:**
- Added epicene 1st/2nd-person pronoun observation to cross-linguistic section
- Explained why locative/temporal fall under gender (same designatum-driven mechanism)
- Added reading guide for inventory table (rows = syntactic function, columns = gender value)
- Clarified folk-psychological vs. social-recognition personhood
- Fixed corrupted LaTeX in chain-coherence paragraph (`\\term` → `\term`)
- Added empirical footprints to each maintenance mechanism:
  - Cognitive grounding: ToM-based pro-form prediction for robots/animals
  - Semantic transparency: rapid assignment for novel entities (AI, fictional creatures)
  - Alignment/repair: frequency/clustering of gender corrections vs. other mismatches

**Commit:**
- `c33a8ff` — Chapter 12: add remaining refinements from feedback
