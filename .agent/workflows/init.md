# HPC Book Project Initialization

This workflow sets up the development environment for the HPC book project.

## Steps

1. **Review project structure**
   - Check existing files and directories
   - Identify the current state of the project

2. **Create necessary directories**
   - Create `chapters/` for book chapters
   - Create `code/` for code examples
   - Create `figures/` for diagrams and images
   - Create `build/` for compiled outputs

3. **Set up version control** (if not already done)
   - Initialize git repository
   - Create `.gitignore` file

4. **Review synopsis**
   - Read the existing synopsis.html to understand the book's scope and structure

5. **Create project overview document**
   - Document the book's structure, goals, and current status
