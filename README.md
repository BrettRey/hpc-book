# Language Without Essences: The Metaphysics of Linguistic Categories

## Project Overview

This repository contains the working materials for a linguistics/philosophy book that argues many core linguistic categories are **Homeostatic Property Cluster (HPC)** kinds rather than essentialist or purely nominalist constructs.

### Core Thesis

Many core linguistic categories are:
- **Real** and stable, not arbitrary
- Characterized by **property clusters**, not necessary/sufficient conditions
- Maintained by **causal mechanisms** (acquisition, entrenchment, transmission, etc.)
- **Fuzzy at boundaries** but projectible for induction

Not every familiar label will survive this treatment: the book also develops diagnostics for when a proposed category is a mere convenience class (thin, fat, or negative).

This framework, adapted from philosophy of biology, resolves longstanding puzzles about category gradience, boundary cases, and cross-linguistic variation.

## Book Structure

The book is organized in four parts:

### Part I: The Problem (3 chapters)
- Diagnosis of essentialism's failures
- Why nominalism/prototype theory leaves stability unexplained

### Part II: The Solution
- Projectibility: Why categories support induction
- Homeostasis: What holds property clusters together
- Failure modes: Recognizing when you don't have a kind

### Part III: Applications
- Countability
- Definiteness
- Word classes
- Constructions
- Phonemes and register (non-grammar worked cases)
- Long-standing puzzles resolved

### Part IV: Implications
- What this means for grammaticality
- Consequences for linguistic practice
- Methodological shifts

## Key Concepts

- **HPC (Homeostatic Property Cluster) kinds**: Categories defined by bundled properties maintained by underlying mechanisms
- **Mechanism**: Causal processes that stabilize category properties (acquisition, entrenchment, interactive alignment, iterated transmission)
- **Gradience without arbitrariness**: Fuzzy boundaries are compatible with real, stable categories
- **Projectibility**: Categories support inductive generalizations because mechanisms are real and stable

## Development Status

- [x] Synopsis drafted (~880 words)
- [x] Part I outline complete
- [x] Part II outline complete
- [ ] Part III outline
- [ ] Part IV outline
- [x] **Chapter 1** drafted and revised (introduction to HPC framework)
- [x] **Chapter 2** drafted and revised (essentialism critique, Aristotle rehabilitation)
- [x] **Chapter 3** drafted (nominalist retreat, Shilluk example)
- [x] **Chapter 5** drafted and revised (discreteness problem, hyperreal formalization)
- [ ] Remaining chapter drafts
- [x] Figures for Chapters 1, 2, 5
- [x] Bibliography (~3700 entries)

## Next Steps

1. Continue Packaging Board feedback implementation (Chapters 1–3)
2. Draft remaining chapters (Part III–IV)
3. Integrate cross-chapter forward/back references
4. Final polish pass on completed chapters
5. Compile and review complete manuscript

## Editorial Notes

- **Chapter 4 restored (Dec 4, 2025)** as HPC introduction chapter. The book now has 14 chapters total across 4 parts.
- This is a **foundations book** that makes explicit the metaphysics underlying grammatical category theory. The goal is not just to provide a useful analytical tool, but to correctly characterize what grammatical categories *are* and transform what questions linguists ask and what answers they accept.
- **Chapter 5 revision (Dec 4, 2025)**: Consolidated from draft, implemented advisory board feedback (Boyd, Rosch, Dąbrowska, Jackendoff, Godfrey-Smith, Croft), and addressed Packaging Board concerns (front-loading, defensiveness, paragraph load, syntactic texture). Renamed to "Discrete from continuous" to reflect focus.
