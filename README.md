# Language Without Essences: The Metaphysics of Grammatical Categories

## Project Overview

This repository contains the working materials for a linguistics/philosophy book that argues grammatical categories are **Homeostatic Property Cluster (HPC)** kinds rather than essentialist or purely nominalist constructs.

### Core Thesis

Grammatical categories (nouns, determiners, constructions, etc.) are:
- **Real** and stable, not arbitrary
- Characterized by **property clusters**, not necessary/sufficient conditions
- Maintained by **causal mechanisms** (acquisition, entrenchment, transmission, etc.)
- **Fuzzy at boundaries** but projectible for induction

This framework, adapted from philosophy of biology, resolves longstanding puzzles about category gradience, boundary cases, and cross-linguistic variation.

## Book Structure

The book is organized in four parts:

### Part I: The Problem
- Diagnosis of essentialism's failures
- Why nominalism/prototype theory leaves stability unexplained
- The cost of unclear foundations

### Part II: The Solution
- Projectibility: Why categories support induction
- Homeostasis: What holds property clusters together
- Failure modes: Recognizing when you don't have a kind

### Part III: Applications
- Countability
- Definiteness
- Word classes
- Constructions
- Long-standing puzzles resolved

### Part IV: Implications
- What this means for grammaticality
- Consequences for linguistic practice
- Methodological shifts

## Key Concepts

- **HPC (Homeostatic Property Cluster) kinds**: Categories defined by bundled properties maintained by underlying mechanisms
- **Mechanism**: Causal processes that stabilize category properties (acquisition, entrenchment, interactive alignment, iterated transmission)
- **Gradience without arbitrariness**: Fuzzy boundaries are compatible with real, stable categories
- **Projectibility**: Categories support inductive generalizations because mechanisms are real and stable

## Development Status

- [x] Synopsis drafted (~880 words)
- [ ] Part I outline
- [ ] Part II outline
- [ ] Part III outline
- [ ] Part IV outline
- [ ] Chapter drafts
- [ ] Examples and case studies
- [ ] Bibliography

## Next Steps

1. Develop detailed outlines for each part
2. Identify key examples and case studies
3. Draft chapters sequentially
4. Create supporting figures and diagrams
5. Compile bibliography
6. Draft and revise complete manuscript

## Notes

This is a **foundations book** that makes explicit the metaphysics underlying grammatical category theory. The goal is not just to provide a useful analytical tool, but to correctly characterize what grammatical categories *are* and transform what questions linguists ask and what answers they accept.
