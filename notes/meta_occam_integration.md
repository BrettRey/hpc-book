# Meta-Occam Integration: Krakauer's Concept Applied to the HPC Book

## The Concept

From David Krakauer (Santa Fe Institute, Jim Rutt Show EP 192):

> "There are domains of human inquiry where the parsimony is in the *process*, not in the final object... Darwin came up with processes which are very parsimonious. You can express and explain the theory of evolution by natural selection in a few sentences, and you don't need more natural selection to explain a worm than an elephant."

**Meta-Occam**: Parsimony at the mechanism level, complexity at the object level.

## How This Frames the HPC Book

The book's central claim is meta-Occam:

- Linguistic categories are **complex** (fuzzy boundaries, overlapping features, gradient judgments)
- But the **stabilizers** that maintain them are **identifiable and relatively few**

You're not claiming categories are simple. You're claiming the *maintaining processes* are tractable.

## Where to Integrate

### Primary: Chapter 4 (Homeostatic Property Clusters)

Add to the section introducing mechanisms:

> The HPC framework offers a meta-Occam stance toward linguistic categories. Occam's razor typically demands parsimony in the *theory*—simple objects, few parameters. But for complex adaptive systems, the parsimony moves up a level: the *mechanisms* are parsimonious; what they produce is not. You don't need a more complicated theory of natural selection to explain an elephant than a worm. Similarly, you don't need a more complicated theory of category maintenance to explain the English definite article than a Swahili noun class. The stabilizers—acquisition, entrenchment, alignment, transmission—are the same at every grain; what differs is the profile they maintain.

### Secondary: Chapter 7 (The Stabilizers)

Reinforce when summarizing the stabilizer inventory:

> This is the meta-Occam payoff: a small inventory of mechanisms maintaining an open-ended variety of categories. The stabilizers recur across levels; they don't multiply with each new case.

### Tertiary: Chapter 8 (Failure Modes)

Connect to the "teeth" argument:

> The meta-Occam constraint is also a filter. If a proposed kind requires a bespoke stabilizer—a mechanism that applies only to it, with no parallel elsewhere—that's evidence of explanatory gerrymandering, not discovery.

### Optional: Chapter 15 (What Changes)

Frame as methodological payoff:

> The framework recommends looking for parsimony in the *process*, not the *object*. Linguists should stop expecting tidy category definitions and start expecting tidy mechanism inventories.

1. ~~Should meta-Occam be a named frame?~~ **Yes**—use the term, but introduce it clearly with the Darwin parallel.
2. ~~Primary home: Ch 4?~~ **Yes**—introduce in mechanisms section.
3. ~~Citation preference?~~ **Published paper** (Frontiers in Complex Systems, 2023).
