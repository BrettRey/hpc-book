# Advisory Board Report: Chapter 13 ("The Stack")

**Date**: January 16, 2026
**Advisors**: William Croft (Radical CxG), Carl Zimmer (Science Communication)
**Missing**: Adele Goldberg (agent stalled)

## Executive Summary
Both advisors validate the core argument (especially the "negative cases") but critique the "Stack" metaphor itself. Croft warns of reifying layers that should be a continuum; Zimmer finds "Stack" inert and "Stabiliser-weighting" industrial. Convergence on "Risk Management" or "Gradient of Constraint" as better framings.

## 1. The Metaphor Problem
Both advisors stumble on "The Stack".

*   **Zimmer**: "Inert layers... classic computer memory." misses the biological dynamism of the argument. Suggests **"Gradient of Constraint"**:
    *   Phoneme constrained by **body** (physics)
    *   Morpheme constrained by **brain** (memory/processing)
    *   Construction constrained by **crowd** (social convention)
*   **Croft**: Risks reifying "levels" that Radical CxG rejects. Morphemes are just minimal constructions. If "The Stack" implies ontological tiers, it fails. Must emphasize it's a **continuum of constructional types** with varying opacity.

## 2. Terminology & Visuals
*   **"Stabiliser-weighting"**: Zimmer calls it "heavy, industrial." Suggests "Mixing Board" or framing mechanisms as active antagonists to entropy ("fighting a war against noise").
*   **Transparent vs Opaque**: Zimmer identifies this as the "lightbulb moment" but suggests framing it as **"Risk Management"**:
    *   Bottom level risk = Physical (mishearing) $\to$ Mechanism: Quantal regions
    *   Higher level risk = Social (misunderstanding) $\to$ Mechanism: Convention/repair

## 3. Empirical Grounding
*   **Phonemes**: Croft warns against using PHOIBLE signatures to claim "universal categories." Distinguish *descriptive categories* (language-specific) from *comparative concepts* (analyst tools). Physics constrains the design space, but doesn't create a universal "Phoneme" kind.
*   **HistWords/Vectors**: Zimmer finds the jump to CS jarring ("natural history to computer science"). Needs a bridge explanations: vectors are "tracing the path of cultural drift."

## 4. The Validation
*   **Negative Cases**: Universal acclaim.
    *   **Croft**: Correctly diagnosing "polysynthetic" as a loose label rather than a kind "validates the framework." Proves it has discrimination power.
    *   **Zimmer**: "Strongest asset." Proves it's not a "Just So Story."

## Recommendations for Revision
1.  **Soften "The Stack"**: Keep the title if needed, but introduce "Gradient of Constraint" or "Continuum" early. Explicitly deny ontological strata (appeasing Croft).
2.  **Active Mechanisms**: Rewrite mechanism descriptions to be active verbs (fighting entropy), not passive structural supports.
3.  **Risk Management Framing**: Add a paragraph in §13.3 linking opacity/transparency to the *type of risk* (physical vs. social) being managed.
4.  **Vector Bridge**: Add a transition sentence in §13.3 explaining *why* embeddings capture drift (fossils of usage).
