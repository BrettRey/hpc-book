The Bybee and Moder (1983) findings on the *string/strung* class are the empirical bedrock you need for **Chapter 4**. While I established that categories have internal structure—prototypes and gradients—rather than Aristotelian boundaries, Bybee and Moder took that cognitive reality and proved it lives in the grammar itself, not just in semantic taxonomies of birds or furniture. They demonstrate that speakers do not memorize a list of exceptions; they operationalize a "product-oriented schema." This perfectly validates the "Property Cluster" component of HPC. You should deploy this in Section 4.1 or immediately preceding the discussion of Ambridge, as it provides the concrete linguistic evidence that these messy, graded clusters are functionally real and psychologically active.

The crucial value of HPC here—and why this moves beyond my original formulation of prototype theory—is the focus on *causal homeostasis*. My work described the topography of the landscape (centrality vs. periphery), but HPC explains the geology that forms it. Bybee and Moder hint at this by showing how the class expanded historically through phonological attraction, but they lack the vocabulary to call this a "homeostatic mechanism." By framing their data through HPC, you solve the defect mentioned in your Chapter 4 draft: you explain *why* the prototype remains central. The mechanism of analogical attraction serves as the stabilizer, constantly pulling new verbs (like *dig* becoming *dug*) toward the attractor basin of the /ʌ/ vowel, maintaining the category's integrity over time.

Therefore, use Bybee and Moder in **Chapter 4** to ground the philosophy, but revisit them in **Chapter 7** to illustrate the mechanism. In Chapter 4, their study refutes the "honeycomb" argument; it proves the schema is not just an emergent accident (a hexagon) but a productive cognitive tool that speakers wield to reshape their language. Then, in Chapter 7, under "Acquisition pathways" or "Dynamical basins," you can explicate exactly how the "cue validity" they measured acts as the feedback loop that creates the stability. They provide the *what* (the graded cluster); HPC provides the *how* (the homeostatic maintenance).
