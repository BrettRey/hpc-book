# O'Connor Engagement + HPC Grain-of-Analysis Notes

## Cailin O'Connor as Friendly Stress-Test

### Key texts
- *Games and Kinds* — sharpest "yes-but" to property-cluster realism
- *Measuring Conventionality* — information-theoretic tools for degrees of arbitrariness
- Earlier work on perceptual categories, ambiguity, generalisation

### Chapter-by-chapter engagement

#### Chapter 4 (Homeostatic Property Clusters)
Use *Games and Kinds* as foil. Her sim-max models argue that even when terms appear to respect property structure, they can still be conventional—shouldn't expect terms to track clusters when payoffs hinge on something else. 

**Response needed**: Clarify exactly what *mechanism + inductive payoff* constraints rescue HPC from promiscuous realism.

#### Chapter 7 (Homeostasis—why categories hold together)
Her formal models of how communication structures, incentives, and social dynamics stabilise/destabilise collective outcomes. Mechanistic template transferable to linguistic category maintenance via acquisition + alignment + transmission.

**Caution**: O'Connor's models assume rational agents optimizing payoffs. Frame game-theoretic results as characterizing equilibria that acquisition/entrenchment mechanisms *find*, not as explanations in themselves.

#### Chapter 8 (Failure modes—thin, fat, negative)
*Measuring Conventionality* gives quantitative-ish "diagnostic companion" to thin/fat/negative taxonomy:
- thin cluster ↔ high arbitrariness / low functional anchoring
- fat cluster ↔ mixed payoff-relevant dimensions bundled
- negative ↔ mostly conventional coordination with little homeostatic support

#### Chapter 12 (The stack)
Cross-level continuity: same family of evolutionary/game-theoretic tools motivate why stabilisation problems recur from perceptual categorisation up through morphosyntax and constructions.

### Priority engagements (if bandwidth limited)
1. *Games and Kinds* — force HPC commitments to maximum crispness about when linguistic categories align with property clusters
2. *Measuring Conventionality* — strengthen diagnostics with graded, mechanism-sensitive arbitrariness notion

**Synthesis**: *O'Connor is right about the failure modes; here's the disciplined HPC criterion set that predicts when those failures occur and when they don't.*

## The Grain-of-Analysis Problem: What's Actually an HPC?

### Disciplinary labels fail
- "Syntax", "phonology", etc. organised by what we ask questions about, not what holds answers together
- Aggregate across mechanisms; pool phenomena maintained differently in different languages

### Viable candidates
- **Specific language's prosodic system** or **morphological paradigm classes** — population + mechanisms identified
- **Modality-specific signed-language structure** — modality provides genuine cross-linguistic mechanism
- **Individual constructions** (form-meaning pairings) — this is where the HPC is

### The grammaticality theory test

Brett's theory defines grammaticality by *how it's maintained*:
1. Morphosyntactic form M(u) successfully evokes meaning μ(u)
2. Meaning compatible with semantic-pragmatic context (K ≈ 1)
3. Pairing entrenched in community (C^t above threshold)
4. Entrenchment maintained/eroded by identifiable forces (frequency, noise detection, prestige, analogy)

**Projectibility**: Knowing pairing is grammatical predicts:
- Production without self-repair
- Comprehension without excess processing cost
- Acceptability to community members
- Measurable entrenchment indicators
- Dynamics following logistic model under perturbation

**Homeostasis**: Unified mechanisms across all constructions:
- Cognitive: availability, processing fluency, noise detection
- Social: prestige, norm enforcement, correction
- Structural: analogical support

### Why individual constructions are the right level

| Level | Status | Covariance | Mechanisms |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Individual construction | HPC | Tight | Unified |
| Construction family (e.g., resultatives) | Possibly HPC | Moderate | Shared with local variation |
| English morphosyntax | Ecosystem of HPCs | Loose | Similar but independent |
| English morphosyntactic meaning | Functional domain | Very loose | Different subsystems |
| Morphosyntax (cross-linguistic) | Taxonomy | Minimal | Heterogeneous |

### The Madagascar analogy
Biological species are HPCs. "The fauna of Madagascar" is not—it's an assemblage of HPCs that happen to co-occur. Species interact and share environmental pressures, but don't form single property cluster maintained by unified mechanisms.

English morphosyntax is like fauna of Madagascar: collection of HPCs (constructions) that interact and share context (speech community), but not itself single HPC.

### Key insight
The model locates grammaticality at *individual form-meaning pairings*. That's where the HPC is. "English morphosyntax" and "English morphosyntactic meaning" are abstractions over many such pairings—useful taxonomic categories without the mechanism-maintained unity HPCs require.

## Phonology-meaning mispairing note

Phonological violation (*/ŋæt/ for *gnat*) isn't ungrammatical in this sense—different kind of ill-formedness. Grammaticality bounded to morphosyntax-meaning pairings specifically.

## Confidence assessments (from discussion)

| Claim | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| Individual constructions (form-meaning pairings) are HPCs | 0.80 |
| The formalization provides right mechanism story | 0.75 |
| "Grammatical construction" (mechanism-defined) avoids fat problem | 0.70 |
| "The grammar of English" (as system) is an HPC | 0.55 |
| Cross-linguistic "grammaticality" is still too fat | 0.85 |
| "English morphosyntax" is too fat | 0.60 |
| "English morphosyntactic meaning" is too fat | 0.75 |
