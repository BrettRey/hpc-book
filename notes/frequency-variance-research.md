## Key Citable Sources

### Divjak (2017) — Polish that-clauses
- **Citation**: Divjak, D. (2017). The role of lexical frequency in the acceptability of syntactic variants: Evidence from that-clauses in Polish. *Cognitive Science*, 41(2), 354–382.
- **Key finding**: Box-and-whisker plots show wider whiskers (more variance) for low-frequency verb quartiles. Acceptability ratings exhibit large variance for rare constructions.
- **Quote**: "Acceptability judgments are based on configurations of internally structured exemplars, the acceptability of which can't reliably be assessed until sufficient evidence about the core component has accumulated."
- **Figures**: Box-and-whisker plots of acceptability by frequency quartile.
- **Caveats**: Focuses on Polish that-clauses; generalization to other languages requires cross-linguistic comparison.

### Favier & Huettig (2023) — Core vs. peripheral Dutch syntax
- **Citation**: Favier, S., & Huettig, F. (2023). Grammatical knowledge and processing of core vs. peripheral syntactic structures. *Lingua* (in press).
- **Key finding**: Core constructions: 90% acceptance, SD=0.09. Peripheral constructions: 57% acceptance, SD=0.27. **Three times higher variance for peripheral items.**
- **Figures**: Table 1 (means and SDs), Figure 2 (item difficulty scatter).
- **Caveats**: Dutch data; core/peripheral distinction defined by linguists' intuitions.

### Graziano-King (1999) — English comparative morphology
- **Citation**: Graziano-King, J. (1999). *Acquisition of comparative forms in English*. PhD dissertation, CUNY.
- **Key finding**: High-frequency adjectives (old, long, fast) took -er in 99% of responses (near-zero variance). Low-frequency adjectives (lax, gaunt) took -er in only 15% of responses. Nonce words: ~50% (maximum entropy).
- **Caveats**: Production preference, not direct acceptability; but a clean proxy for judgment reliability.

### Sassenhagen et al. (2018) — Verb argument structure
- **Citation**: Sassenhagen, J., Blything, R., Lieven, E. V. M., & Ambridge, B. (2018). Frequency sensitivity of neural responses to English verb argument structure violations. *Collabra: Psychology*, 4(1), 38.
- **Key finding**: Error rate 6.58% for low-frequency verbs vs. 1.58% for high-frequency. Significant frequency × grammaticality interaction.
- **Figures**: Table 1 (verb frequencies), Table 3 (Bayesian results), Figure 1 (accuracy and ERP strength).
- **Caveats**: Small sample (n=16); repetitive stimuli.

### Bresnan (2007) — Dative alternation
- **Citation**: Bresnan, J. (2007). Is syntactic knowledge probabilistic? Experiments with the English dative alternation. *Roots: Linguistics in search of its origins*, 75–96.
- **Key finding**: Acceptability ratings are a linear function of corpus probability. Rare alternants show gradient, noisy ratings (high variance) rather than categorical rejection.
- **Figures**: Scatter plots of probability × acceptability.

## Summary for Chapter 6

The prediction is testable: core (high-frequency) category members should yield consistent judgments; peripheral (low-frequency) members should yield higher variance. The evidence supports this:
- Peripheral syntactic structures show ~3× the judgment variance of core structures (Favier & Huettig 2023)
- High-frequency adjectives elicit near-unanimous agreement; low-frequency items split speakers (Graziano-King 1999)
- Low-frequency verbs show 4× higher error rates in acceptability tasks (Sassenhagen et al. 2018)

The variance isn't noise; it's the signature of weak entrenchment.
