# Chapter 2 Planning: Essentialism and its Discontents

## Strategic Considerations

### Examples Already Deployed in Chapter 1

**Lexical items:**
- *otherwise* (adverb/adjective/preposition boundary)
- *cattle* (defective noun paradigm, stable for 500 years)
- *the* (weak definites, generic definites)
- reciprocals (*each other*, *one another*)
- *fun* (noun becoming adjective)
- *near* (preposition/adjective hybrid)
- *pease* (mass noun that regularized, contrast with *cattle*)
- *worth* (adjective/preposition hybrid)
- *fast*, *like*, *quickly* (intersection zones)

**Structural/phonological:**
- /ɪ/ vs /ɛ/ before nasals (PIN-PEN merger)
- Resultative construction (*thought myself through that problem*)

**Historical:**
- Subject–auxiliary inversion change in English

**Theoretical examples:**
- Baker's [+N, −V] feature system
- Katz's semantic features (*bachelor* = [+adult, +male, +unmarried])
- Bloomfield's structural phonemes

### Examples Reserved for Later Chapters

From the outline:
- **Ch 9 (Countability)**: Count/mass distinction, peripheral cases
- **Ch 10 (Definiteness)**: Form-meaning misalignment (already previewed with *the*)
- **Ch 11 (Word classes)**: Adjective-adverb asymmetry, noun/verb stability
- **Ch 12 (The stack)**: Phonemes, morphemes, constructions

## What Chapter 2 Needs to Accomplish

Per outline:
1. The essentialist default: necessary and sufficient conditions
2. Systematic failures: *furniture*, *the*, reciprocals
3. Boundary cases aren't noise—they're evidence

### Your Additional Constraints

1. **Not lexical-centric**: Need examples across linguistic domains
2. **Rapoport's rules**: Steel-man essentialism first—show what it enabled
3. **Wrong map, not wrong data**: Essentialism blocks productive questions
4. **Biology parallel**: Decide placement (Ch 2 vs Ch 5 vs distributed)
5. **Strategic ammunition**: Don't shoot everything here; save examples for later chapters

## Proposed Structure for Chapter 2

### 1. Essentialism's Achievements (~3 pages)
**Rapoport's rules in action**

What essentialism got right AND what it enabled:
- The great descriptive grammars (Jespersen, Quirk, \textit{CGEL}) used essentialist architecture to organize massive amounts of data
- Cross-linguistic comparison became possible (structural linguistics)
- Parsers, pedagogy, systematic description all depend on treating categories as if they have sharp boundaries
- Generative grammar's productivity: discovering deep syntactic regularities (island constraints, c-command, binding principles)
- Phonological discoveries: distinctive features, natural classes, phonotactic constraints

**Key message**: Essentialism was a powerful **data-generating** framework, even if it lacks explanatory depth

### 2. Where the Map Misleads (Core of chapter, ~10-12 pages)

Not just "definitions fail" but "the search for definitions blocks better questions"

#### Strategy: Organize by DOMAIN rather than example type
Show essentialism failing across linguistics, not just in lexical semantics

**A. Phonology: The phoneme problem**
- Allophonic variation that graduatesinto phonemic contrast
- Example: /t/ in English (aspirated, unaspirated, glottalized, flapped)
- Essentialist question: "What are the necessary features of /t/?"
- Blocked question: "What mechanisms maintain /t/-properties as a cluster across contexts?"
- Historical: The Great Vowel Shift—categories in motion

**B. Morphology: Inflectional class membership**
- Strong vs weak verbs in Germanic
- Example: English irregular verbs (*sing-sang-sung* pattern)
- Essentialist treats as lexical exceptions
- Better question: What mechanisms maintain these unproductive patterns? (Frequency, type/token ratios, analogical pressure)

**C. Syntax: Grammatical relations**
- The "subject" problem cross-linguistically
- Essentialist search for universal definition of SUBJECT
- Better question: Is SUBJECT a single cross-linguistic kind, or multiple language-specific kinds? (Preview Ch 8 failure modes)

**D. Semantics: The *furniture* problem**
- Already flagged in synopsis, should be developed here
- Why does *furniture* resist plural morphology despite being a count concept?
- Essentialist answer: Stipulate it's a "collective noun"
- Better question: What mechanisms maintain its mass-syntax + individuation-semantics profile?

**E. Construction grammar: Argument structure**
- The dative alternation (*give X to Y* vs *give Y X*)
- Not all verbs participate; participation is gradient
- Essentialist search for "dative-alternating verb" definition fails
- Better question: What mechanisms (semantic, phonological, frequency) predict gradient participation?

#### Note on examples:
- Use *furniture* here (flagged in synopsis)
- Use phonemes (reserves the more detailed analysis for Ch 12)
- DON'T use countability extensively (reserve for Ch 9)
- DON'T use adjective-adverb boundary in detail (reserve for Ch 11)
- DON'T use definiteness in detail beyond what Ch 1 already did

### 3. The Pattern: Blocked Questions (~3 pages)

What unites all these cases?

Essentialism makes linguists ask:
- "What is THE definition?"
- "Which features are necessary?"
- "Is this item IN or OUT?"

HPC makes linguists ask:
- "What mechanisms bundle these properties?"
- "Why this configuration and not others?"
- "Where do mechanisms weaken or compete?"

**The shift**: From **definition-seeking** to **mechanism-seeking**

### 4. The Biology Parallel (~2-3 pages)

**My recommendation: Put biology HERE, not in Ch 5**

Rationale:
- Ch 2 is about what essentialism blocks
- Showing what it blocked in biology (and what HPC opened) makes the parallel concrete
- Ch 5 will introduce HPC theory; this is motivation, not technical introduction
- Later chapters can then cite specific biology examples as needed without rehearsing the whole story

**What to include:**
- Ring species as "category errors" vs informative data
- Horizontal gene transfer invisible under essentialism
- Conservation biology: can't ask "what mechanisms should we preserve?" if seeking essences
- Speciation events: gradual, not categorical

**What it opened:**
- Mechanism-based conservation
- Predictive models of population dynamics
- Understanding hybridization as data, not anomaly

**The parallel:**
- Biology: From "What is a species?" to "What maintains this population?"
- Linguistics: From "What is a noun?" to "What maintains this category cluster?"

### 5. Bridge to Chapter 3 (~1-2 pages)

These failures tempt the retreat to gradience/nominalism:
- If definitions fail, maybe there are no real categories?
- Maybe it's all just family resemblance?
- Maybe categories are constructed, not discovered?

Chapter 3 will show why that retreat, while capturing something real, abandons too much.

## Total Estimated Length: ~18-22 pages

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Biology placement**: Do you agree it should go in Ch 2, or would you prefer Ch 5 or distributed?

2. **Domain balance**: Does the phonology → morphology → syntax → semantics → constructions progression work? Any domains to add/remove?

3. **The *furniture* example**: This is flagged in the synopsis. How detailed should it be here vs saving depth for Ch 9?

4. **Tone balance**: Does this structure steel-man essentialism enough before critique?

5. **Examples for other chapters**: Are there specific phenomena you want to reserve for later chapters that I should explicitly avoid here?

## Great Science Communicators: Structural Precedents

### For the "Achievements" section:
- **Gould's approach**: Show the framework's genuine successes before revealing its limits
- "The gradualist paradigm organized a century of paleontology; its failure to predict stasis is not a refutation but a clue"

### For the "Blocked questions" section:
- **Dennett's approach**: Identify the seductive intuition pump
- "Essentialism makes 'What is X?' feel like the deepest question, when often 'What maintains X?' is more productive"

### For the Biology parallel:
- **Dawkins's approach**: Use extended analogy to build new intuition
- The species problem isn't just similar to the grammatical category problem—it's *structurally identical*

## Next Steps

1. Discuss this structure
2. Decide on biology placement
3. Select specific examples for each domain
4. Begin drafting sections
