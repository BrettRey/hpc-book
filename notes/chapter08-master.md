# Chapter 8: Failure Modes — Thin, Fat, Negative

**Subtitle:** *How to know when you don't have a kind*

---

## Drafted Status (December 2025)

**Status:** Initial draft complete (`chapters/chapter08.tex`)

**Sections drafted:**
- §8.1 The Inflation Problem (O'Connor "payoff vs property" distinction)
- §8.2 Thin Clustering: The Smoke Ring (*whose*-stranding case study)
- §8.3 Fat Clustering: The Wastebasket (Adverb case study)
- §8.4 Negative Diagnosis (*non-finite* case study)
- §8.5 The Grain of Analysis (Madagascar analogy)
- §8.6 Principled Criteria: The Two-Diagnostic Test
- §8.7 Implications

**Key decisions made:**
- Framing: "Inflation Problem" as central antagonist
- O'Connor integration: "Payoff vs Property" is the diagnostic
- Thin = "smoke rings" (pure convention without immune system)
- Fat = "wastebaskets" (labels for absence of features)
- Grain solution: Madagascar analogy (constructions = species, grammar = fauna)
- Two-Diagnostic Test from `stack.tex` manuscript
- **LBE Case Study Selection:** Left Branch Extraction selected as primary "Negative Diagnosis" example.
- **Hypothesis:** LBE ban is not a rule but a "gap of abstinence" maintained by workarounds.

**Open questions for revision:**
- O'Connor's *Measuring Conventionality* not yet fully unpacked
- Intervention operationalisation needs concrete examples
- Cross-linguistic test cases for negative/fat failures need development

## Purpose in Book Structure

Chapter 8 is the **falsifiability guardrail** for the HPC framework. While Chapters 4–7 build the positive case (what HPC kinds are, how they're maintained, why they project), Chapter 8 provides the discipline: how do we know when a putative category *fails* to earn HPC status?

This answers Boyd's worry about the "inflation problem" — the tendency to hear HPC music everywhere once you like the tune. The chapter provides principled criteria for kind-hood and shows what it looks like when those criteria aren't met.

## Three Failure Modes

### 1. Thin Clustering
**Definition:** Insufficient homeostasis — not enough mechanisms, or mechanisms too weak, to produce stable clustering.

**Characteristics:**
- Properties co-occur but don't stay together under perturbation
- High inter-speaker variation without systematic patterning
- Predictions based on category membership fail frequently
- Low entrenchment; forms drift easily

**Linguistic examples:**
- Nonce coinages (too new for mechanisms to operate)
- Idiolectal forms that never diffuse
- "Categories" defined by a single distributional context
- Ad hoc groupings for experimental convenience

**Diagnostic test:** Does the cluster resist perturbation? If removing one property doesn't shift the others, the clustering is thin.

**O'Connor connection:** High arbitrariness / low functional anchoring

---

### 2. Fat Clustering
**Definition:** Multiple kinds lumped together — too many mechanisms pulling in different directions, heterogeneous groupings under a single label.

**Characteristics:**
- Properties cluster, but in subgroups that don't cohere
- Predictions work for some members but fail systematically for others
- Cross-context generalisation fragments by subtype
- The label is historically inherited rather than causally grounded

**Linguistic examples:**
- Traditional "adverb" class (manner adverbs, sentence adverbs, degree words, conjuncts)
- Cross-linguistic "subject" if it pools languages with different mechanisms
- "Auxiliary" if it groups modal, aspectual, and voice markers without mechanism story
- "Particle" as a wastebasket category

**Diagnostic test:** Do predictions trained on one subclass generalise to others? If not, the category is fat.

**O'Connor connection:** Mixed payoff-relevant dimensions bundled together

---

### 3. Negative Diagnosis
**Definition:** Taxonomic convenience, not natural kind — the label organises files but doesn't track causal structure.

**Characteristics:**
- Category defined by what it's NOT (complement class)
- No positive clustering; members share only the absence of features
- No mechanisms maintaining the grouping
- Useful for exposition but not for prediction

**Linguistic examples:**
- "Non-finite" (defined by absence of tense/agreement marking)
- "Minor word classes" (defined by not being major classes)
- "Peripheral" constructions (defined by not being core)
- "Peripheral" constructions (defined by not being core)
- Cross-linguistic "topic" if defined only by not being subject/object
- **Left Branch Extraction (LBE):** The "Left Branch Condition" is a reified gap. English speakers don't *prohibit* LBE; they just never *reach* for it because headed/fused alternatives cover the space (Reynolds 2026).

**Diagnostic test:** Is there a positive property cluster, or only a negative definition? If the latter, it's not an HPC kind.
**Metaphor:** "The dog that didn't bark" — abstinence, not impossibility.

**Diagnostic test:** Is there a positive property cluster, or only a negative definition? If the latter, it's not an HPC kind.

**O'Connor connection:** Mostly conventional coordination with little homeostatic support

## Principled Criteria for Kind-hood

A category earns HPC status if:

1. **Clustering:** Properties reliably co-occur (diagnostic cluster exists)
2. **Stability:** The cluster persists under perturbation (mechanisms are operating)
3. **Projectibility:** Predictions based on category membership succeed across contexts
4. **Mechanism identification:** At least some stabilising mechanisms can be named
5. **Intervention sensitivity:** Removing or weakening a mechanism predicts cluster drift

A category fails HPC status if:
- Clustering is too thin (insufficient mechanisms)
- Clustering is too fat (heterogeneous mechanisms)
- No positive clustering exists (negative diagnosis)

## Chapter Structure (Proposed)

### §8.1 Introduction
- The inflation problem: everything looks like an HPC once you like the framework
- The need for discipline: criteria that exclude as well as include
- Preview of thin/fat/negative taxonomy

### §8.2 Thin Clustering
- Definition and characteristics
- Worked example: nonce coinages, idiolectal forms
- Diagnostic: perturbation resistance
- Connection to degrees of projectibility (Ch7)

### §8.3 Fat Clustering
- Definition and characteristics
- Worked example: traditional "adverb" class
- Worked example: cross-linguistic "subject" (if pooled without mechanism story)
- Diagnostic: cross-subtype generalisation

### §8.4 Negative Diagnosis
- Definition and characteristics
- Definition and characteristics
- **Worked example: Left Branch Extraction (LBE)**
  - Traditionally: The Left Branch Condition (structural constraint)
  - HPC view: A "statistical void" maintained by competitor density (pied-piping, fused-head)
  - "Abstinence" vs "Impossibility"
  - Why it doesn't satiate (absence of evidence in massive opportunity set > lab exposure)
- Worked example: "non-finite" (secondary example)
- Why negative definitions don't ground induction
- Diagnostic: positive clustering test

### §8.5 The Grain-of-Analysis Problem
- What level is the right level for HPC analysis?
- Individual constructions vs. construction families vs. "the grammar of English"
- The Madagascar analogy: species are HPCs, fauna of Madagascar is not
- Key insight: individual form-meaning pairings are where the HPC is

### §8.6 Criteria for Kind-hood
- The five-part test (clustering, stability, projectibility, mechanism, intervention)
- How to apply it
- What counts as evidence for each criterion

### §8.7 Implications
- For typology: same cross-linguistic label doesn't guarantee same HPC
- For theory: labels without mechanisms are descriptive, not explanatory
- For methodology: falsifiability is built in

## Key Sources to Engage

- **O'Connor, "Games and Kinds"** — sharpest "yes-but" to property-cluster realism; forces HPC commitments to maximum crispness
- **O'Connor, "Measuring Conventionality"** — quantitative diagnostics for arbitrariness; strengthens thin/fat/negative taxonomy
- **Khalidi (2013)** — simple causal theory as alternative to HPC; useful foil
- **Haspelmath (various)** — comparative concepts; when cross-linguistic labels fail to track mechanisms

---

## Connections to Other Chapters

- **Ch4:** Introduces HPC framework; Ch8 provides the discipline
- **Ch6:** Projectibility; Ch8 explains why some labels don't project
- **Ch7:** Stabilisers; Ch8 shows what happens when stabilisers are insufficient
- **Ch11 (Word Classes):** Applies grain-of-analysis; adjective/adverb distinction may be fat clustering
- **Ch12 (The Stack):** Scale-invariance; failure modes recur across levels

## Draft Opening

> The maintenance view offers a powerful lens: categories are real because mechanisms keep them stable. But power comes with risk. Once you like the lens, you start seeing HPHC kinds everywhere — in every distributional cluster, every gradient judgment, every cross-linguistic recurrence. This chapter provides the discipline. Not everything that clusters is a kind. Not every label that linguists use tracks causal structure. The question is not "can I tell an HPC story about this?" but "does the HPC story make predictions that an alternative story doesn't?" Three failure modes help answer that question: thin clustering (not enough mechanisms), fat clustering (too many mechanisms pulling in different directions), and negative diagnosis (no mechanisms at all, just taxonomic convenience). Each is a way of not being a kind — and each is diagnostic of something important about the category in question.

## Notes

- This chapter is where the framework proves it can say "no"
- The thin/fat/negative taxonomy should become a methodological tool
- The grain-of-analysis problem (from oconnor-and-hpc-levels.md) is key: individual constructions are the right level, not "the grammar of English"
- Confidence assessments from earlier notes can inform which examples to develop
