# Category vs. Class: Not a Demotion

**Status:** ✅ Added to Chapter 8 (after line 33)

## The Point

Diagnosing something as a **class** rather than a **category** is NOT a demotion. Both serve purposes:

| Type | Useful For |
|------|-----------|
| **Category** (HPC kind) | Induction, predicting deficits, explaining acquisition |
| **Class** (nominal grouping) | Organising curricula, structuring textbooks, enabling communication |

The question is not "Is this term legitimate?" but "What kind of work are we asking it to do?"

## Insertion Point

Added to Chapter 8, §8.1 (The inflation problem), after the paragraph ending "...when is it merely a convenient label?"

> A word about framing: diagnosing something as a class rather than a category is not a demotion. Both serve purposes. Classes organise curricula, structure textbooks, enable communication. Categories support induction, predict deficits, explain acquisition. The question is not 'Is this term legitimate?' but 'What kind of work are we asking it to do?'

## Failure Mode Terminology

The three failure modes are all ways a putative **category** turns out to be merely a **class**:

- **Thin class** — insufficient mechanism to maintain clustering
- **Fat class** — lumps distinct mechanisms under one label
- **Negative class** — defined by absence, no positive cluster

## Connection to Floyd et al. 2025

"Pragmatics" is a useful class for organizing research; its three components (social conventions, intonation, causal reasoning) are the categories with projective force. Neither is wrong — they're tools for different purposes.
