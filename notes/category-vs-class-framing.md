# Category vs. Class: Not a Demotion

**Key framing point** — integrate into main prose, not as sidebar.

## The Point

Distinguishing **category** (HPC kind) from **class** (nominal grouping) is NOT a value hierarchy. Both serve important purposes:

| Type | Useful For | Not Useful For |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Category** (HPC kind) | Prediction, induction, explaining mechanisms, supporting generalizations | — |
| **Class** (nominal grouping) | Organizing curricula, structuring textbooks, defining research communities, communication | Predicting deficits, explaining development, identifying shared mechanisms |

**Example:** "Pragmatics" as a class is perfectly useful for organizing coursework; it fails as a category for predicting which phenomena share processing resources.

The HPC framework doesn't say "classes are bad" — it says "don't expect inductive power from a nominal grouping." The confusion arises when we *treat* a class as if it were a category.

## Where to Integrate

### Chapter 2 (kinds vs. classes distinction)
When first distinguishing natural kinds from constructed classes, add a paragraph:
> "This is not a value hierarchy. Constructed classes serve essential purposes: organizing curricula, indexing research communities, enabling communication. The diagnostic question is not 'Is this term legitimate?' but 'What kind of work are we asking it to do?'"

### Chapter 8 (fat/thin clusters)
When diagnosing fat clusters, reinforce:
> "Identifying 'pragmatics' as a fat cluster is not a demotion. It redirects inquiry: ask not 'What is pragmatic competence?' but 'Which of its dissociable components supports the inference I'm studying?'"

### Chapter 14 (implications/conclusion)
Meta-point:
> "The maintenance view doesn't tell us what to care about. It helps us match our analytical tools to our goals — and dissolves some questions by revealing them as artifacts of treating classes as categories."

## Connection to Floyd et al. 2025

This is exactly what Floyd et al. show: "pragmatics" is a useful class for organizing research, but its three components are the categories with projective force. Neither is "wrong" — they're tools for different purposes.
