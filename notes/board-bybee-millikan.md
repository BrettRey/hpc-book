Bybee & Moder (1983) should do its main philosophical work in **Chapter 7**, not merely as a flashy data-point in **Chapter 4**. Chapter 4 is where you introduce HPC structure (prototype, graded membership, family resemblance), but Chapter 7 is where you argue for *what sort of thing* such a category is: something maintained through time by stabilising processes. From a teleosemantic standpoint, that is exactly where their *string/strung* results belong—where the book turns from “this is the shape of the category” to “this is how the category persists as a public object.”

The diachronic expansion they document is evidence of lineage in the only sense that matters here: reproduction by copying a pattern. It is not that later speakers literally copy earlier tokens, like scribes copying a manuscript, but that they reproduce a *schema*—a way of making and hearing past tenses—guided by similarity to a prototype. That is copying-with-variation, and it is what distinguishes a merely clustered set from a *reproductively established family*. The fact that membership can change (the class “recruits” new verbs as similarity permits) without the kind dissolving is a hallmark of historical individuals, not of definitional sets.

So cite Bybee & Moder (1983) in **Chapter 7** under transmission/acquisition feedback: use their cue-validity and gradient productivity findings to illustrate a stabiliser that has both a producer-side and a consumer-side proper function. Speakers are disposed to generate the /ʌ/-type past tense in the right neighborhood; hearers are disposed to treat that output as a past-tense cue; the mutual success of these coordinated dispositions is what keeps the cluster clustered across generations. Then, in **Chapter 4**, a shorter, forward-pointing citation can introduce the case as “one of the cleanest empirical demonstrations” that HPC structure is psychologically real—without trying to extract the metaphysics too early.

The metaphysical point the data supports is that the relevant unit is not an abstract rule nor a static similarity class, but a historically sustained pattern whose unity is functional. On my picture, the *string/strung* class exists because a lineage of tokens has been reproduced under selection for communicative uptake; its “kindhood” is grounded in proper function, not in shared essence. That dovetails with your maintenance view: HPC homeostasis is not an optional add-on to a pre-given category—it is constitutive of what the category is, and Bybee & Moder provide a case where we can actually see that constitution at work in both synchronic gradients and diachronic spread.
