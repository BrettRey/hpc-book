# Chapter 10 Grist — Definiteness and Deitality

## Veil/Hat Contrast

A minimal pair showing the semantic cluster (familiarity/identifiability) dissociating from the morphosyntactic form:

- *She wears the veil* — generic/institutional reading; no specific veil is identified
- *She wears a hat* — standard indefinite; a specific but unidentified hat
- *?She wears the hat* — marked; requires discourse context establishing which hat

The "the veil" case is a **weak definite** or **institutional definite** — the definite article co-occurs with a generic reading, violating the standard uniqueness/familiarity semantic analysis.

### HPC Relevance

This is the form-meaning misalignment the chapter predicts:
- The **form cluster** (definite article, uniqueness presupposition trigger, anaphoric licensing) is one HPC
- The **function cluster** (identifiability, familiarity, discourse givenness) is another HPC
- They usually align, but cases like *the veil* show they can decouple

The coupling is maintained by:
- High-frequency co-occurrence (definite form usually = definite meaning)
- Pragmatic inference (hearers assume identifiability when they hear *the*)
- But weak definites are entrenched exceptions — institutionalized decoupling

### Related Cases

- *play the piano* (institutional)
- *go to the hospital* (BrE) vs. *go to the hospital* (AmE — specific)
- *the Pope* (role definite — unique by role, not by discourse)
- Generic definites: *The tiger is endangered*
