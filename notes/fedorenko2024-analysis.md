# Fedorenko et al. (2024) — Two Papers

## Paper 1: "The language network as a natural kind"
**Citation:** Fedorenko, E., Ivanova, A. A., & Regev, T. (2024). The language network as a natural kind within the broader landscape of the human brain. *Nature Reviews Neuroscience*.
**Relevance:** 0.80–0.90 (very high)

### Key Claims
1. **The language network IS a natural kind** — explicitly uses this term
2. **Strong functional interconnectivity** — areas work together for common goal
3. **Distinct from perception, motor, and cognitive systems** — separable component
4. **Responsive to meaning, not just surface features** — unlike perceptual areas
5. **Identified via functional localization, not anatomy** — respects brain's intrinsic organization

### HPC Connections
- Fedorenko uses "natural kind" language for a neural system — provides neural grounding for HPC argument
- Her criteria for natural-kind-hood (functional cohesion, interconnectivity, causal distinctness) parallel HPC criteria
- Variability across individuals + stability within individuals = maintenance view signature
- The network is "discovered" via functional localization, not imposed — aligns with mechanism-first ontology

### Where to Cite
| Chapter | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Ch 7** | Neural stabilisers — the language network as maintained kind |
| **Ch 4** | HPC as natural kind — neural evidence for category reality |
| **Ch 14** | Big picture — linguistics continuous with neuroscience |

## Paper 2: "Language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought"
**Citation:** Fedorenko, E., Piantadosi, S., & Gibson, E. (2024). Language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought. *Nature*, 630, 575-586.
**Relevance:** 0.70–0.80 (high)

### Key Claims
1. **Language is for communication, not thought** — challenges Chomsky/Fodor
2. **Language network is dissociable from reasoning networks** — distinct systems
3. **Language does not require or enable specific forms of thought** — double dissociation
4. **Language-for-thought hypothesis lacks empirical support** — systematic review

### HPC Connections
- Aligns with Scott-Phillips: communicative function is primary
- Supports HPC claim that linguistic categories are maintained by communicative pressure, not by thought structures
- The dissociability of language from reasoning = evidence for distinct maintenance mechanisms
- Useful for pushing back on Chomskyan "language of thought" objections

### Where to Cite
| Chapter | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Ch 7** | Functional feedback — communicative function as forcing function |
| **Ch 14** | Big picture — language's function is communication |
