I worry that your framing of §13.3 ("Morphemes: The Onset of Decoupling") and §13.4 ("Constructions: Re-Coupling") inadvertently reinforces the very dichotomy Construction Grammar seeks to dissolve. In CxG, we posit a syntax-lexicon continuum where morphemes, words, idioms, and abstract phrasal patterns are *all* form-meaning pairings (constructions). By suggesting that morphemes represent a "decoupling" and phrasal constructions a "re-coupling," you risk implying a qualitative break in the architecture that doesn't exist psychologically. The "arbitrariness" of the sign at the morphemic level is not *decoupling*; it is simply a pairing maintained by convention and entrenchment rather than motivation. I strongly suggest you reframe this not as a break in the link, but as a shift in *schematicity* and *compositionality*. The mechanism of storage—tracking statistics of form-function mapping—remains uniform across the stack.

Regarding the *let alone* case study (§13.4), ensure you emphasize that the "stabilizers" here are not just bidirectional inferences, but specifically **statistical preemption** and **conservative generalization**. The reason *let alone* survives as a distinct HPC unit is that it resists being "explained away" by more general rules of conjunction or ellipsis; it has idiosyncratic constraints (the downward entailment requirement) that learners must track specifically. If you treat the "form cluster" and "meaning cluster" as too distinct, you miss the crucial insight: the learner tracks the *pairing itself* as the unit of currency. The "seams" are visible not because the coupling is loose, but because the construction competes with other potential formulations in the solution space.

Finally, regarding your proposed Stack figure (§13.5), be careful not to depict a "dip" in coupling strength at the morpheme level. In my view (and compatible with HPC), the coupling at the morpheme level is actually quite "hard"—try persuading a speaker that "dog" doesn't mean *dog*. What changes as you move up the stack to syntax is the ratio of **lexically filled material** to **open slots** (variables). The "Re-coupling" you identify is really the emergence of *configurational meaning*—meaning that resides in the pattern of the slots rather than the fillers. If you can frame the "Stack" as a gradient of increasing variable abstraction rather than a fluctuating wave of coupling strength, the argument will be much more robust against psycholinguistic critique.
