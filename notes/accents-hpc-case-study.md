# Accents as HPC Case Study

## The Question

Do accents fit the category/class distinction? Specifically:
- Are "accents" HPC kinds or fat clusters?
- What maintains them?
- What about cross-linguistic patterns (e.g., gay male speech features that seem to travel)?

---

## Tentative Analysis

### Language-specific accents → likely HPCs

Maintenance mechanisms:
- Social reinforcement / identity marking
- Accommodation (convergence in interaction)
- Transmission within speech communities
- Functional pressure for in-group intelligibility

Features cluster predictably (e.g., Boston non-rhoticity + TRAP-BATH split).

### Regional umbrella labels → likely fat clusters

"Southern American English" or "British accent" lump multiple distinct maintenance communities. Projectibility may fail across sub-varieties.

### Cross-linguistic "gay male speech" → class or convergent evolution?

Features that seem to travel:
- Higher pitch / wider pitch range
- Extended sibilant duration
- Hyperarticulation
- Certain prosodic contours

Hypothesis: The **functional target** (identity signaling) is universal, but **realizations** are language-specific HPCs that converge due to:
1. Physiological/acoustic affordances
2. Global media transmission
3. Convergent functional solutions

Parallel to evidentiality (Ch 8): cross-linguistic comparandum vs. language-internal HPCs.

## Research to Find

- Ron Smyth (U Toronto) — sibilant duration, pitch in gay male speech
- *Do I Sound Gay?* (David Thorpe documentary)
- Cross-linguistic studies of sexuality-indexing speech patterns

---

## Potential Book Location

- Part III case study (sociolinguistic HPCs alongside grammatical ones)
- Or: brief mention in Chapter 8 (failure modes) as example of convergent evolution
