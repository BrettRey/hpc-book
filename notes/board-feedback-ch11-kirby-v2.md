# Board Feedback: Chapter 11 (Kirby)

**From:** Simon Kirby

**Subject:** The compression heuristic and the illusion of unity

The insight in the grist—that "different mechanisms converge on the same distributional property"—is precisely where cultural transmission becomes the explanatory engine. You ask whether transmission creates or exposes these "braided" categories. From the perspective of iterated learning, the answer is emphatic: **transmission creates the braid.**

### 1. The Braid as Compression
A learner does not have access to the functional history of a linguistic item (whether it originated from deixis, anaphor, or variable binding). They only have the PLD (Primary Linguistic Data). When diverse functional pressures result in similar surface distributions (e.g., determiner resistance), the transmission bottleneck forces the learner to generalize.

To a learner, treating "referentially saturated items" as distinct, unrelated lists is computationally expensive. Grouping them into a single distributional category ("things that refuse determiners") is a compression strategy. The "braid" is not a metaphysical truth about the world that language discovered; it is a cognitive efficiency hack that language evolved. The category exists *because* the bottleneck forced diverse phenomena into a single, learnable box.

### 2. The Problem of Fat Categories (Adverbs)
You mention "fat" categories like adverbs as a potential failure mode or "wastebasket." Iterated learning makes a specific prediction here: **heterogeneity is unstable.**

If "adverb" is truly a "wastebasket" (a collection of items with no shared structural core), it should not survive transmission. Systems evolve toward compositionality and regularity. If a category is too "fat," the bottleneck should either:
1.  **Fragment it:** Learners will fail to learn the "wastebasket" and instead learn several smaller, tighter categories (unbraiding).
2.  **Regularize it:** Learners will impose a structure that wasn't there, forcing the outliers to conform or die.
3.  **Protect it via Frequency:** The only way a chaotic category survives is if its members are individually high-frequency enough to be learned by rote (the "irregular verbs" effect).

If "adverb" persists as a unified label in linguistics but lacks unity in the learner's mind, it is an analyst's fiction. But if it persists in the grammar, there must be a hidden attractor—a learnable generalization—that binds it, or we are looking at a collection of high-frequency fossils.

### 3. Turning Tendencies into Rules
The chapter should frame transmission as the mechanism that **hardens functional tendencies into structural constraints**.

The grist notes that semantic redundancy (no need for 'the') leads to syntactic absence. In a single generation, this is just a pragmatic tendency. But over generations, the learner receives data where 'the' is absent. To reproduce this pattern without infinite memory, the learner posits a rule: "Category X forbids determiners."

Transmission is the mechanism that forgets the "why" (redundancy) and remembers only the "what" (distribution). It braids the category by stripping away the functional nuance and leaving only the structural skeleton. The "unity" of the category is the scar tissue left by the transmission bottleneck.
