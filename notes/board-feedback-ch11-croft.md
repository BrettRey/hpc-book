From an RCG perspective, the HPC framework offers a metaphysical warrant for what constructional typology has long observed: word classes are emergent, gradient clusters rather than predefined essences. In RCG, categories are epiphenomena of constructional distributions; they are not primitives but abstractions over recurring form-function pairings. HPC kinds dovetail with that view by explaining why some abstractions are stably projectible. The noun/verb contrast can be treated as a HPC because multiple stabilizers converge: argument structure, discourse functions of reference and predication, acquisition biases, and entrenched constructional schemas. Adjective/adverb variation then falls out as a weaker cluster with fewer convergent stabilizers and more construction-specific organization, which fits RCG's cross-linguistic variability.

Constructions are therefore not just the evidence for categories; they are the mechanisms that maintain them. The chapter should lean into the idea that constructional networks enforce the clustering: recurring slot constraints, semantic roles, and pragmatic functions create attractor basins that keep noun/verb distinctions stable, while permitting different alignments for modifiers. In RCG terms, the "category" is the emergent effect of a constructional network; in HPC terms, the network is the homeostatic mechanism. Highlighting that identity will strengthen the bridge between HPC and CxG/RCG. This framing also clarifies why typological diagnostics should target constructional behavior rather than isolated morphology.

On form/function, RCG resists a strict separation: constructions are pairings, and categories are defined by the functions they serve in those pairings. The chapter should therefore avoid treating form and function as independent kinds that merely align; instead, present them as coupled clusters whose alignment is mediated by constructional organization. Misalignments (e.g., adjective-like functions realized in verb-like forms) are not failures but stable alternative equilibria in the constructional ecology. Explicitly framing form/function as co-stabilized dimensions within constructional profiles would keep the chapter aligned with RCG and prevent a return to essentialist bifurcation.
