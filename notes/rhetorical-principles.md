# Rhetorical Principles: The McCloskey Audit

Derived from the "Disciplinary Judo" approach and the board reports for Chapters 6–10.

## 1. Disciplinary Judo (The Generous Turn)
**Principle:** Never simple contradictions; always sublation.
Instead of saying "The traditional view is wrong," say "The traditional view captures X perfectly, but struggles with Y."
*   **Why:** Direct negation triggers defensiveness. Generous framing validates the reader's prior knowledge before extending it.
*   **The Move:** "This isn't a mistake; it's a first approximation that hits a wall."
*   **Example (Ch 7):** Changed "causal pretensions" (accusatory) to "causal ambitions" (aspirational).
*   **Example (Ch 9):** Changed "is the wrong question" to "obscures the underlying dynamics."

## 2. Pain Amplification (Sell the Itch)
**Principle:** Before selling the solution (HPC/Deitality), you must sell the problem.
*   **Why:** Readers are comfortable with their wastebaskets. You need to make the wastebasket feel uncomfortable—show the epicycles, the "special rules," the arbitrariness.
*   **The Move:** Make the "one category" view look like a bureaucracy of exceptions.
*   **Application:** In Chapter 10, don't just introduce "Deitality" immediately. First, spend time on the "veil/hat" puzzle to show how the old map fails to guide them.

## 3. Strategic Alienation (The Virtue of Ugliness)
**Principle:** Use clunky or unfamiliar terms to break conceptual reflexes.
*   **Why:** Smooth terms like "definiteness" trigger slideware thinking—the reader assumes they know what you mean.
*   **The Move:** "Deitality" is intentionally ugly. Its clunkiness forces the reader to stop and map the concept manually, breaking the automatic "Definite = Unique" association.
*   **McCloskey's take:** "The term's virtue is alienation... It clunks like a dropped wrench."

## 4. Vulnerability as Trust (Kill Your Darlings)
**Principle:** Explicitly state what would falsify your claim.
*   **Why:** It disarms skeptics. It shows you aren't hiding behind vague metaphyics.
*   **The Move:** "If we found a language with X but without Y, my theory would die."
*   **Application:** The "Natural Experiments" sections in Ch 9 and 10.

## 5. Depersonalize the Error
**Principle:** Critique the model, not the person.
*   **Why:** "PhD students" and "editorialists" are people. "Textbook definitions" and "standard models" are ideas.
*   **The Move:** Remove snark.
*   **Example:** Removed "desperate newspaper editorialists" (Ch 7). Changed "lie detector" to "reality check" (Ch 8).
