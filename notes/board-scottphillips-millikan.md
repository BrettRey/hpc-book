Scott-Phillips’ byproduct hypothesis is immediately congenial to a teleosemantic picture: “linguistic intuitions” are not a faculty for *detecting grammatical essences*, but an effect of consumer-side mechanisms trying to make communicative tokens do their job. If you treat acceptability judgments as outputs of systems designed for uptake (interpretation under time/effort constraints), then it becomes unsurprising that they track breakdowns in *consumability*—no cognitive payoff, gratuitous extra cost, or clashing constructional functions—rather than some inner “grammar meter.” That is precisely the stance an HPC-friendly naturalism needs: the ontology is in the reproduced public patterns, while the psychology explains how those patterns are stabilized and how we (imperfectly) detect them.

On (1): I would not call “optimal relevance” a *proper function* in my sense. Proper functions belong to historically reproduced items and mechanisms (words, constructions, interpretive routines) and specify what they are *supposed* to do given their lineage. “Optimal relevance” is instead a regulative assumption the consumer system uses under normal conditions: it is a gloss on the success-condition for consumption (roughly, that producers normally don’t impose processing costs without compensating effects). Teleosemantically, the proper function sits with the construction token—getting a certain coordination/information-transfer job done—and with the comprehension apparatus—recovering that job; “relevance” is an efficiency constraint on how those functions are ordinarily achieved, not itself the function to be maximized.

On (2): the byproduct framing supports rather than undermines your HPC programme, provided you keep the levels straight. It blocks the inflationary move from “we have a strong intuition” to “there is a deep structural kind here,” which is exactly the methodological warning an HPC account should issue. At the same time it gives you a plausible stabilizing story: variants that reliably frustrate consumption (because they are costly without payoff, or because they put incompatible constructional functions in the same place) will be selected against in cultural transmission. The only danger is rhetorical: if “byproduct” is heard as “mere epiphenomenon,” readers may slide back into thinking grammar is nothing over and above general pragmatics. Counter that by insisting that constructions are reproductively stabilized types with proper functions in a lineage; the byproducts live in the consumer’s reactions to successes and failures of those functions.

On (3): cite Scott-Phillips primarily in **Chapter 8**, wherever you motivate the acceptability/grammaticality dissociation and caution about intuitions as evidence (they are diagnostic traces of consumer-side processing and function-fit, not transparent reports of the kind). Then add a secondary citation in **Chapter 7** when you enumerate stabilisers: his “presumption of (so-called) optimal relevance” is best presented there as one concrete forcing function linking communicative success to differential retention of forms, i.e., one strand in the homeostatic braid.
