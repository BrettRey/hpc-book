The “stack” metaphor largely lands for a lay reader because you begin with a simple, relatable contrast—mishearing a word vs. misinterpreting a sentence—and use that to motivate different kinds of error. That said, “stack” can feel a bit software‑ish and architectural, and “stabiliser weighting” is a dense phrase for the very first pass. I’d give the reader a brief, concrete image before naming the term: a mixing board with sliders, or a recipe with a few dominant ingredients. Then introduce “stabiliser weighting” as “which forces do most of the holding.” You already do the conceptual work; this is mostly about giving it a friendlier coat at the moment you coin the label.

The empirical sections are strongest when they stay tactile and visual—the /ɪ/–/ɛ/ contrast, the pin/pen merger, and the regularisation‑frequency curve are crisp and plausible. The later computational claims feel less grounded, mainly because they lean on metrics (“macro‑F1,” “PR‑AUC”) and placeholders without giving readers a sense of the dataset scale, what “chance” looks like, or what a good classifier means in everyday terms. For a lay science audience, I’d translate those numbers into a single human‑scale comparison (“twice as accurate as guessing,” “as reliable as a quick medical screen”), and give one or two concrete counts (how many languages in PHOIBLE, how many decades in HistWords, how many constructions in the classifier). That doesn’t require heavy statistical exposition—just enough anchoring to make the evidence feel solid rather than provisional.

Clarity could also improve by translating the core diagnostics into plain‑spoken glosses right where they first appear. You do define projectibility and homeostasis, but in the same breath you use both terms as if they’re already familiar; a quick paraphrase—“do patterns travel?” and “do we see forces that keep the bundle together?”—would lower the entry cost. The stabiliser‑map figure is honest about being schematic, which is good, yet its axes still read like a technical memo. Consider a short “reader’s guide” sentence in the caption: left is “hard to read meaning off form,” right is “meaning rides on form,” bottom is “policed by institutions,” top is “held by the body and ear.” That makes the diagram legible without diluting the argument.

Finally, for Zimmer‑style narrative flow, I’d pull one tiny story thread through the chapter—say, a single lexical item or construction that you revisit at each level—and use it as the reader’s handrail. That would help the “stack” feel less like a taxonomic diagram and more like a journey. It would also make your negative cases punch harder: by the time we reach “academic register,” the reader will have a vivid sense of what a real stabiliser looks like—and why this one isn’t it.
