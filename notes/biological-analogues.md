## Hero Examples

### 1. Immune Cell Types (Macrophages, T-cell Subsets)

**Why it's a great analogue:**

1. **Clustered properties, not essences**
   - Picked out by constellation: functions (phagocytosis, antigen presentation), marker profiles, morphologies, response tendencies, developmental origins
   - None strictly necessary/sufficient across contexts

2. **Stabilisation is explicitly multi-level**
   - **Gene regulatory networks** → robust "attractor" states
   - **Developmental lineage constraints** → certain states easier to reach/maintain
   - **Signalling environments** (cytokines, tissue context) → push cells into related regions
   - **Functional feedback** → what cell does alters microenvironment, sustains/shifts state

3. **Controlled tolerance for variation**
   - "Same kind, different activation state"
   - = "Same constructional family, different discourse-conditioned realisations"

### 2. Birdsong Categories

Bridge case: stabilisers map onto linguistic toolkit:
- **Learning biases** (developmental constraints)
- **Social reinforcement and imitation** (community-level feedback)
- **Communicative function** (selection pressures)
- **Ecology and signalling environments** (context-sensitive shaping)
- **Population structure and drift** (variation without category collapse)

## The Porting Template

1. **Start with the cluster**
   "What properties tend to co-occur for X in language?"

2. **Name stabilisers at multiple scales**
   - Cognitive/processing constraints
   - Acquisition and learning trajectories
   - Interactional/discourse functions
   - Social network structure
   - Historical drift and contact

3. **Show reciprocal causation**
   "Usage entrenches representations; entrenched representations shape usage."

4. **Treat variation as diagnostic, not embarrassing**
   "Different activation states of the same category under different environments."

5. **Link mechanism story to projectibility**
   "These stabilisers explain why knowing one member lets you predict others—*and* why prediction sometimes fails at the edges."

## Concept Map: Biology → Linguistics

| Biological Domain | Linguistic Analogue |
|---|---|
| Gene regulatory networks | Cognitive architectures + processing biases |
| Developmental lineage | Acquisition pathways + learning biases |
| Microenvironmental signalling | Discourse context + pragmatic ecology |
| Functional selection | Communicative efficiency + social indexing |
| Population structure | Speech community networks + diffusion dynamics |
| Attractor states | Entrenched constructions/categories |

## Rhetorical Posture

> The category is real because the stabilising story is real, not because the boundary is definitionally crisp.

## Integration Notes

- Could be section in Chapter 7 showing how biologists narrate multi-level stabilisation
- Or could be implicit template guiding how linguistic mechanisms are presented
- "Same kind, different activation state" = key frame for handling variation
