## Query 1: Prototypes in Cognitive Linguistics

### HIGHLY RELEVANT

| Paper | Why Useful | Chapter |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Taylor 2008** "Prototypes in cognitive linguistics" (147 cites) | Reviews prototype effects as challenge to classical categories; explicitly applies to grammatical categories | Ch 2, Ch 10 |
| **Taylor 2017** "Syntactic constructions as prototype categories" (207 cites) | Prototype effects in structural categories (noun, subject); shows pervasiveness through 'adjective' example | Ch 8, Ch 10 |
| **Lakoff 1973** "Fuzzy grammar" (209 cites) | Classic: rules apply to a degree, gradience in grammaticality | Ch 2 |
| **Kemmer 2011** "Grammatical prototypes and competing motivations" (49 cites) | Cross-linguistic marking as evidence for universal salience of some categories | Ch 8 |
| **Kendig 2016** "Natural kinds and classification in scientific practice" (94 cites) | Discusses HPC theory explicitly as alternative to classical kinds; has linguistics contributor | Ch 2, Ch 4 |

### USEFUL CONTEXT

| Paper | Why Useful |
|-------|------------|
| Taylor 2004 "Grammatical categories" | Fuzzy boundaries (WORD ↔ AFFIX ↔ CLITIC) as evidence |
| Cuenca 2013 "Fuzzy boundaries between discourse and modal marking" | Dynamic categorization; items defy classification |
| Furkó et al. 2019 "Fuzzy Boundaries in Discourse Studies" | Discourse markers as heterogeneous category |

## Query 2: Word Classes / Parts of Speech

### HIGHLY RELEVANT

| Paper | Why Useful | Chapter |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Hollmann 2012** "Word classes: Towards a more comprehensive usage-based account" (23 cites) | Phonology + distribution in categorization; nonce word experiment | Ch 10 |
| **Hollmann 2013** "Nouns and verbs in Cognitive Grammar" (36 cites) | Phonological cues in word class assignment | Ch 10 |
| **Barner & Bale 2002** "No nouns, no verbs" (127 cites) | Argues against lexical categories; psycholinguistic evidence for underspecification | Ch 8 (negative diagnosis?) |

### THEORETICAL CONTRAST

| Paper | Why Useful |
|-------|------------|
| Evans & Levinson 2009 "With diversity in mind" (51 cites) | Cross-linguistic counterexamples to universal word classes |
| Berent 2009 | Argues for experimental testing of universals |

## Query 3: Count/Mass Acquisition

### HIGHLY RELEVANT — directly for Chapter 9

| Paper | Why Useful | Chapter |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Gordon 1982** "The acquisition of syntactic categories: count/mass" (72 cites) | Tests semantic vs. syntactic acquisition; subcategorization rules | Ch 9 |
| **Gordon 1988** "Count/mass category acquisition: Distributional distinctions" (125 cites) | Obligatory determiner rule as maintenance mechanism; distributional evidence | Ch 9 |
| **Doetjes 2017** "The count/mass distinction in grammar and cognition" (Annual Review) (25 cites) | Core knowledge systems + counting/individuation | Ch 9 |
| **Chierchia 2018** "Syntactic bootstrapping and mass-count" (65 cites) | Pluralization as diagnostic; syntactic bootstrapping | Ch 9 |
| **Ambridge 2020** "Against stored abstractions" (239 cites) | Radical exemplar: NOUN/MASS/COUNT as emergent, not stored | Ch 9, Ch 4 |

### USEFUL CONTEXT

| Paper | Why Useful |
|-------|------------|
| Lin et al. 2018 "Interpretation of mass-count across languages and populations" | L2 learners rely on lexical-semantic rather than morphosyntactic |
| Gathercole 1986 "Evaluating competing linguistic theories with child language data" | Processing mechanisms for mass-count |
