# The Semantic-Morphosyntactic Braid: Why This Interface?

Generated: 2025-12-15
Context: Brainstorming session exploring why semantic and morphosyntactic properties couple tightly while other interfaces (phonotactics, discourse) show weak coupling.

## The Core Observation

Grammar appears to be a "braid" of two cables - semantic and morphosyntactic - that twist together to form grammatical categories. But this coupling is SPECIFIC to the semantics-morphosyntax interface:

| Level | Semantic Coupling |
|-------|-------------------|
| Phonotactics | Minimal (indexical at best - dialect, register) |
| **Morphosyntax** | **Tight** - the main event |
| Discourse | Present but diffuse (topic/focus, rhetorical relations) |

**The question**: Why does coupling peak at morphosyntax?

---

## Six Candidate Hypotheses (All Explored)

### 1. Compositional Parallelism
Both morphosyntax and semantics are recursively compositional in structurally isomorphic ways. The meaning of a phrase is a function of its parts; the structure of a phrase is a combination of its parts. This parallel architecture creates natural coupling points.

**Key insight**: The morpheme is the "quantum" of form-meaning coupling. Below it (phonology): formal composition without meaning. At and above it: compositional parallelism constrains coupling.

### 2. Timescale Alignment
Morphosyntax and semantic composition operate at the same temporal grain (~300-1000ms for phrase/clause). Phonotactics is too fast (~50-200ms). Discourse is too slow (seconds to minutes).

**Key insight**: Timescale alignment is a FACILITATOR, not the primary explanation. Turkish evidential -mIş has morpheme-level duration but clause-level semantic scope - yet couples tightly. Obligatoriness trumps timescale.

### 3. Selection Relations
Morphosyntactic categories SELECT for semantic properties. Verbs select arguments with semantic roles. Quantifiers select count/mass. This selection creates bidirectional inference: hearing X → infer Y; wanting to express Y → choose X.

**Key insight**: Selection is the architectural feature that bidirectional inference exploits. C-selection (morphosyntactic) and s-selection (semantic) are the two clusters in the two-HPC architecture.

### 4. Learnability Bottleneck
For language to be learnable, form-meaning mappings must be recoverable from input. Morphosyntax is the optimal zone - systematic enough to learn, variable enough to be useful.

**Key insight**: Learnability is necessary but not sufficient. Phonology is highly learnable (acquired by age 2) but doesn't couple to meaning. The FOUR-PROPERTY CONVERGENCE matters: regularity + productivity + obligatoriness + learnability.

### 5. Zone of Maximum Systematicity
Morphosyntax is where grammar LIVES - the level where systematicity is maximized. Not too fine-grained (phonemes have no meaning), not too coarse-grained (discourse is too variable).

**Key insight**: OBLIGATORINESS is the critical variable. Only semantic distinctions that can be made obligatory at morpheme/phrase/clause level get grammaticalized. This is why tense grammaticalizes but furniture doesn't.

### 6. Prosody as Test Case
Prosody operates at multiple timescales (segment to discourse) and DOES carry meaning (intonation, focus, emotion). It should show intermediate coupling - and it does.

**Key insight**: Prosody couples to a DIFFERENT semantic domain (pragmatic/informational) than morphosyntax (propositional). Two parallel coupling systems exist. When prosody grammaticalizes (tone, pitch accent), coupling tightens to morphosyntactic levels.

## The Convergent Answer: Obligatoriness + Propositional Semantics

All six explorations converge on the same core finding:

**The tight semantic-morphosyntactic coupling exists because propositional meaning REQUIRES obligatory compositional encoding.**

### The Architecture

| Level | Systematicity | Semantic Content | Obligatoriness | Coupling |
|-------|---------------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| Phonology | HIGH | NONE | N/A | NONE |
| Morphosyntax | HIGH | PROPOSITIONAL | HIGH | **TIGHT** |
| Prosody | HIGH | PRAGMATIC | VARIABLE | INTERMEDIATE |
| Discourse | MODERATE | SOCIAL/INTERACTIONAL | LOW | WEAK |

### Why These Two Cables Specifically?

The "two cables" are:
1. **Propositional semantics** - truth-conditional meaning (reference, tense, aspect, number, definiteness)
2. **Compositional morphosyntax** - obligatory, recursive, learnable formal structure

They couple tightly because:

1. **Propositional meaning must be compositionally recoverable** - you can't leave tense to context in English finite clauses
2. **Compositional recovery requires obligatory marking** - every utterance provides evidence for the coupling
3. **Obligatory marking creates dense distributional evidence** - acquisition, entrenchment, transmission all reinforce
4. **Selection relations create bidirectional inference** - form predicts meaning, meaning predicts form

### Why Not Phonology?

Phonology has high systematicity but NO SEMANTIC CONTENT. There's nothing for morphosyntax to couple to. Phonemes are contrastive units (distinguish *pin* from *bin*) but carry no meaning themselves. The morpheme is the minimal meaning-bearing unit - that's where coupling begins.

### Why Not Discourse?

Discourse has semantic content but LOW OBLIGATORINESS. Patterns are defeasible - you can violate discourse conventions without ungrammaticality. Topic continuity, politeness, register - all are useful but optional. Context can recover what explicit marking leaves unspecified.

### Why Is Prosody Intermediate?

Prosody is systematic and operates at the same timescale as morphosyntax (phrase/clause level). But:
1. It's OPTIONAL (focus can be unmarked; context recovers meaning)
2. It's GRADIENT (continuous pitch, duration, intensity)
3. It couples to PRAGMATIC semantics (information structure, stance, affect) not PROPOSITIONAL semantics

When prosody grammaticalizes into tone or pitch accent, it becomes OBLIGATORY and coupling tightens. Otherwise it remains intermediate.

## Implications for the Book

### Chapter 4 (HPC Introduction)
The mechanisms listed (acquisition, entrenchment, alignment, transmission) operate specifically at morphosyntax because that's where obligatoriness lives. Add: "These mechanisms reinforce the coupling because morphosyntax forces every utterance to provide evidence."

### Chapter 7 (The Stabilizers)
The multi-timescale mechanism architecture matches morphosyntactic processing windows (~300-1000ms for phrase/clause). Add discussion of why prosody, despite operating at the same timescale, shows looser coupling (optional, pragmatic).

### Chapter 8 (Failure Modes)
The "cross-cutting" observation (furniture vs animacy) follows from this: semantic distinctions that CAN be made obligatory get grammaticalized (animacy); those that can't remain lexical-conceptual (furniture).

### Chapter 9 (Countability)
The bidirectional inference mechanism works because count constructions OBLIGATORILY select for individuation. This is already implicit but could be made explicit: "The coupling is tight because *a* and *three* require their complements to be construed as individuals - there's no opt-out."

### Chapter 12 (The Stack - if written)
Frame the levels as coupling zones:
- Phonology: formal systematicity, no coupling
- Morphosyntax: formal + semantic systematicity, tight coupling
- Prosody: formal + pragmatic systematicity, intermediate coupling (parallel system)
- Discourse: semantic but defeasible, weak coupling

### Chapter 13 (Grammaticality)
Grammaticality = successful coupling at the obligatory compositional level. A sentence is grammatical when morphosyntactic form successfully evokes compositional meaning AND the form is what the language requires (obligatoriness satisfied).

## Key Quotes for Integration

### On obligatoriness as the key variable:
"Obligatoriness is the critical variable that distinguishes grammatical from lexical/discourse patterns. When a semantic distinction is forced into obligatory morphosyntactic marking, every utterance reinforces the coupling."

### On the morpheme as coupling boundary:
"The morpheme is the quantum of form-meaning pairing. Below it, phonological composition without meaning. At and above it, compositional parallelism constrains how form and meaning align."

### On prosody as parallel system:
"Prosody couples to a different semantic domain - pragmatic rather than propositional. It's not competing with morphosyntax for the same functional space; it's a parallel interface operating on information structure and stance."

### On why two cables:
"The tight coupling isn't arbitrary. Propositional meaning - what you assert about the world - requires obligatory compositional encoding because truth-conditional content must be recoverable. Morphosyntax is where this requirement is met."

## Refinements to "Two Cables" Metaphor

The original metaphor implies tight uniform intertwining. Better framings:

1. **Coupled oscillators**: Two independent systems that phase-lock when feedback loops create stable coupling
2. **Lock and key**: Semantic properties are keys; morphosyntactic constructions are locks with specific tolerances
3. **Railway switching**: Parallel tracks with discrete coupling sites (constructions are the switches)

All capture that:
- The systems are INDEPENDENT (maintained by different mechanisms)
- Coupling is SELECTIVE (only at interface sites)
- Coupling is DEFEASIBLE (can fail - thin clustering, fat clustering)

## Open Questions for Further Exploration

1. **Can we quantify coupling strength?** Mutual information between semantic and morphosyntactic properties; bidirectional conditional entropy.

2. **Do all grammatical HPCs decompose into semantic + morphosyntactic facets?** Test: find a category that's purely formal or purely semantic but still projectible.

3. **What's the threshold for dormancy?** At what point does distributional predictability make semantic transparency expendable? (Polish aspect: F1 ~0.95 seems sufficient)

4. **Is the asymmetry general?** Test count/mass, definite/indefinite, tense oppositions for the same unmarked/marked pattern as aspect.

5. **What predicts grammaticalization targets?** The four filters (cognitive salience, discourse frequency, inferential utility, structural availability) - can this be formalized?

6. **Cross-linguistic variation**: Do languages with richer morphology show tighter coupling? Do isolating languages show the same semantic distinctions but with looser coupling (lexical expression)?
