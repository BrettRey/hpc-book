# Ambridge (2020) "Against Stored Abstractions" — Analysis

**Citation:** Ambridge, B. (2020). Against stored abstractions: A radical exemplar model of language acquisition. *First Language*, 40(5-6), 585-615.
**Relevance:** 0.70–0.80 (high)

## Core Argument

Argues against stored linguistic abstractions (VERB, NOUN, SUBJECT, constructions) in favor of **radical exemplar model**: all linguistic knowledge = stored utterance tokens + on-the-fly analogical generalization.

## Key Arguments for HPC Book

### 1. Lumping/Splitting Dilemma (your exact terminology)
- Classical definitions fail: no necessary/sufficient conditions for *table*, *verb*, *transitive construction*
- Prototype models fail: can't handle non-linearly-separable categories (e.g., *-et* verbs where *netted/bet* are grammatical but **setted/jet* are not)
- "Once you start splitting, you can't stop" (p. 516)

### 2. Family Resemblance Invoked (p. 179)
Cites Rupert: genuine coarse-grained kinds require "family resemblances... determined by overlaps between (a) the causal-explanatory elements that constitute those instances and (b) the relations between those elements."
→ Remarkably close to HPC formulation

### 3. Emergent Structure Without Stored Representations
Categories like NOUN/VERB are "useful descriptive shorthands" but "not represented in the brains of English speakers... they are simply emergent from the processes of language comprehension and production" (p. 511).

### 4. The Honeycomb Analogy (key passage, p. 511):
> "no adequate description of a honeycomb could fail to mention its hexagonal structure, but this structure is not represented in the brains of individual bees, or anywhere else; it is simply emergent from the process of honeycomb formation. Similarly, no adequate description of English could avoid making reference to NOUNs and VERBs but, I argue, these structures are not represented in the brains of English speakers"

## HPC Response

| Ambridge's Position | HPC Response |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Categories aren't stored representations | HPC: categories are real kinds (property clusters) even if not stored as explicit prototypes |
| Lumping/splitting has no solution | HPC: property clusters provide principled intermediate grain |
| Family resemblance determines membership | HPC: this IS the HPC view — overlapping properties, no single defining feature |
| Analogy across exemplars explains productivity | HPC: analogical mechanisms could BE the homeostatic mechanisms |

## Where to Engage

- **Chapter 4** — Position HPC as third way between essentialism and radical exemplar
- **Chapter 5 or 7** — Argue analogical mechanisms ARE maintenance mechanisms
- **Chapter 14** — Meta-point: HPC captures what's right about emergent view while granting categories ontological status

---

## The Convergence Point

Both HPC and radical exemplar models reject essentialism. The question is whether "emergent patterns" constitute real natural kinds. HPC says yes — in virtue of property clustering and maintaining mechanisms.

Ambridge grants categories are real patterns for description while denying they're psychologically stored. HPC bridges: categories are real property clusters maintained by cognitive/usage mechanisms — neither classical categories nor mere epiphenomena.
