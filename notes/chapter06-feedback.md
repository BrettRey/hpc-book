# Chapter 6 Feedback Summary

## Sources
Simulated reviews from: Boyd, Bybee, Dąbrowska, Fahnestock, Tufte, Goldberg, Croft, Godfrey-Smith, McCloskey, Hacking, Khalidi, Dupré

## Top Recurring Issues

| Issue | Who raised it | Status |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| NPI section is abrupt | Structural, Goldberg | DONE - added foil framing |
| Three metaphors compete | Fahnestock, McCloskey | DONE - added partition |
| Lemma-concrete paradox underexplored | Goldberg, Croft, Godfrey-Smith | DONE - added defense |
| No feedback loop shown | Godfrey-Smith, Boyd | DONE - added robustness criterion |
| Individual differences unmarked | Dąbrowska | DONE - added prediction |
| Hostile phrasing | McCloskey | DONE - softened |
| Figures are schematic | Tufte | DEFER |
| Perfective asymmetry unexplained | Godfrey-Smith | DONE - added hypothesis |
| Moderate semantics not acknowledged | Godfrey-Smith | DONE - added parenthetical |
| Volcanic island needs constraint | Godfrey-Smith | DONE - added constraint |
| NPI operational criterion needed | Godfrey-Smith | DONE - added criterion |

## Key Actionables

1. **NPI foil framing** — Add sentence: "Before looking at a complex success, consider a failure..."
2. **Metaphor partition** — One sentence explaining: Tagomi = stakes; turkey = what goes wrong; volcano = how categories drift
3. **Lemma-concrete defense** — The *category* is emergent even if *processing* happens at lemma level
4. **Feedback-loop acknowledgment** — Show maintenance loop or forward-reference to Ch. 7
5. **Dąbrowska prediction** — "Speaker variation is expected when mechanisms are weak or unevenly experienced"
6. **Soften phrasing** — "textbook view fails" → "projects imperfectly"

## Deferred for Later

- Figure revisions (Tufte) — need actual data or remove schematic numbers
- Diachronic evidence for volcanic drift (Godfrey-Smith)
- Cross-linguistic expansion (Croft, Dupré)
