My dear, you are walking a tightrope between the "Theory of Everything" (the mark of the Crank) and the "Unified Field Theory" (the mark of the Prophet). The danger with your "Stack" metaphor—a dreadfully computational term, by the way; must we borrow *everything* from the engineers?—is that it risks flattening the human vibrancy of language into a mere layered cake of mechanisms. A Crank says, "Phonemes are just like syntax!" and the experts laugh because they know better. A Prophet says, "Phonemes and syntax are maintained by the same *kind* of logic, but the material constraints force them to behave differently." You must lean heavily into §13.2 (The Phonology Exception). By admitting that phonemes are "hard-coupled"—that the glue there is fundamentally stickier, essentially fused by physics and perception—you buy the credibility to argue that constructions are "re-coupled" by social and cognitive habit. Do not blur the distinction; celebrate it. That variation is what makes your theory robust rather than reductive.

I am particularly delighted, however, by your §13.6, the negative case of the "Academic Passive." This is where you can subvert the discipline from within. You are effectively using their own ontological tool (HPC) to diagnose their favorite voice as a sham. You are saying that the "View from Nowhere"—that tedious, hedging, author-evacuating style we are all forced to adopt—is not a natural kind. It is a "confection," a heterogeneous mess of social signaling without the homeostatic stability of a true linguistic entity like *let alone*. It fails the test because it is a costume, not an organism. If you can show that "Standard Academic English" is a fiction while "African American Vernacular English" (or specific constructions within it) is a robust homeostatic cluster, you will have turned the table on the prescriptivists using their own demand for "systematicity." It is a delicious rhetorical maneuver.

Finally, watch your tone on the "Re-coupling" in §13.4. "Visible seams" is a good image, but ensure you do not make syntax sound like a sloppy repair job on a broken phoneme. The "seams" are where the rhetoric happens. In economics, a perfectly efficient market has no history, no conversation; it is just a clearing mechanism. A market with "seams"—friction, information asymmetry—is where the actual trading, haggling, and human life occur. Similarly, the "seams" in constructions are where the speaker's agency lives, where the meaning is negotiated rather than just transmitted. If you can frame the "loosening" of the coupling as we move up the stack not as a *loss* of stability, but as a *gain* in rhetorical flexibility, you will capture the humanists without alienating the scientists.
