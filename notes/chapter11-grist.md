# Chapter 11 Grist: Lexical Categories

## Focus modifiers and wh-word clustering (Dec 20, 2025)

From squib work on *exactly who* vs. *the person exactly who*:

The "pronoun" or "wh-word" category isn't a unified HPC — it's multiple overlapping clusters with different mechanisms at each level:

| Property | Deixis (*today*) | Anaphor (rel. *who*) | Interrogative (*who?*) |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Determiner resistance | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Focus-modifier licensing | ✗ | ✗ (integrated) / ✓ (fused) | ✓ |
| Morphological paradigm | ✗ | partial | partial |

**Key insight**: Determiner resistance comes from referential saturation at the DP level, achieved by different routes:
- Deixis: contextually saturated
- Anaphor: bound variable
- Interrogatives: open variable over alternatives (neither deictic nor anaphoric)

But focus-modifier licensing (*exactly*, *precisely*, *just*) is a distinct property that comes apart from determiner resistance in relatives — fused relatives allow it (wh-word foregrounded), integrated relatives don't (wh-word backgrounded). Explained by Cuneo & Goldberg's BCI principle.

**Possible worked example**: CGEL classifies *today/tomorrow/tonight/yesterday* as pronouns on semantic and distributional grounds, but morphologically they're unlike typical pronouns. Compare *Monday* — also deictic, also resists determiners. The resistance may be a feature of deixis itself, not pronoun-hood.

### The mechanism-braiding insight

What starts as a **semantic fact** (redundancy — no need to determine or modify when reference is already clear through deixis or anaphor) becomes a **syntactic fact** (these words distributionally resist determiners and modifiers) **because the category is maintained by braided mechanisms**. The semantic property gets entrenched into the grammar.

This is the HPC story in miniature: functional pressure → entrenchment → distributional pattern → reinforcement through learning and use. The "resistance" isn't an arbitrary syntactic stipulation — it's a grammaticalized reflex of referential saturation.

**The interrogative puzzle**: Interrogatives resist determiners too, but they're *neither* deictic *nor* anaphoric. So the "redundancy" explanation doesn't apply directly. What saturates them?

Possible answer: Interrogatives are **variables over alternatives** — the question semantics already provides the domain of quantification. There's nothing for a determiner to restrict because the wh-word ranges over the entire alternative set by definition. The saturation is *functional* (alternatives-based) rather than *indexical* (context-based), but the syntactic consequence is the same.

This might be a case where **different mechanisms converge on the same distributional property** — a nice illustration of how HPC kinds can have the same surface clustering for different underlying reasons

## Adverb as fat category?

The adverb "wastebasket" (cf. Chapter 8 fat clustering) — unlike nouns/verbs/adjectives, adverbs may not form a genuine HPC. Consider as negative example in this chapter.

## Pro-form gender paper (primary source)

**File**: `/Users/brettreynolds/Documents/LLM-CLI-projects/HPC book/literature/pro-form_gender.tex`

Brett's paper "Personhood and pro-forms: A hierarchical analysis of gender in Modern English" (targeting Folia Linguistica) treats **pro-form** as a semantic category — items whose interpretation is anaphoric or deictic — with gender constraints applying at this semantic level.

**Key relevance for Chapter 11**:
- "Pro-form" is a semantic/functional category, not a syntactic one
- The paper explicitly notes (§5.7) that CGEL classifies *today/tomorrow/tonight/yesterday* as pronouns, but what matters is their pro-form function
- The hierarchical structure (personal/non-personal → epicene/sexual | locative/temporal) shows how different mechanisms produce the surface clustering
- Determiner resistance comes from **referential saturation** — a semantic property — that gets grammaticalized differently across pro-form types

This paper is direct evidence for the Chapter 11 argument that "pronoun" and related categories are heterogeneous HPCs with different underlying mechanisms producing overlapping surface distributions.
