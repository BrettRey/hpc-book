I would place this in **Chapter 4**, specifically as the **opening case study** to introduce the very concept of an HPC kind in linguistics.

While Chapter 7 deals with the "how" (the specific stabilisers), Chapter 4 is where you have to win the battle for the "what." You are trying to convince readers that a category can be fuzzy, lacking necessary and sufficient conditions, yet still be *real* and *causally potent*. Our 1983 analysis of the *string/strung* verbs is the smoking gun for this. We demonstrated that speakers don't memorize a list, nor do they run a rigid rule; they utilize a product-oriented schema based on family resemblance. The fact that the class expanded historically (*dig/dug* joining later) precisely along the lines of phonological similarity proves that this "fuzzy" structure is actually a robust, homeostatic mechanism capable of assimilating new members. If you save this for Chapter 7, you leave the reader floating in abstraction for too long. Ground the metaphysics immediately in the *string/strung* data.

The value HPC adds to our original work is the explicit move from **psychological reality** to **ontological status**. In 1983, we were fighting to show that "fuzzy" categories were cognitively real and not just performance errors. HPC takes this a step further: it grants these categories the status of *natural kinds*. You can use our data to say, "Look, the *string* class isn't just a convenient description of speaker behavior; it is a homeostatic property cluster where the 'homeostasis' is provided by the analogical attraction to the prototype." Our "product-oriented schema" *is* the homeostatic mechanism.

I would also suggest a callback in **Chapter 7** under your "Dynamical Basins" section (Table 7.1). The *string* class is a perfect illustration of a "basin of attraction." We showed that the closer a novel verb is to the phonological prototype (the bottom of the basin), the more likely it is to take the irregular past tense. This bridges your biological analogy perfectly: the "gene regulatory network" of the language (the schema) makes the *string* shape an energetic low point that pulls words into it.
