Abstract

This paper proposes a hierarchical gender system for Modern English centred on pro-forms -- items that take their meaning from another element in discourse. I argue that English exhibits a primary value distinction between personal and non-personal gender, realized most systematically by gender-sensitive pro-forms, with sexual gender (masculine/feminine) functioning as a subcategory of personal gender. This system extends beyond personal pronouns to include relative pronouns, interrogatives, and determinatives (especially in pro-form function); gender percolates to morphological relatives and semantic neighbours. Unlike grammatical gender systems where the antecedent controls gender, in English it's the designatum -- how an entity is conceptualized -- that determines gender selection. The personal gender designates entities construed as personal in discourse, while non-personal gender applies to entities not so construed. This analysis reveals systematic patterns previously obscured by accounts that treat gender as merely a three-way distinction limited to pronouns.

# 1. Introduction

Gender in English is about persons: who counts as a person, how we signal personhood, and why personhood matters to grammar. English gender is a referential system organized around attributed personhood and realized across pro-forms. The term [gender]{.smallcaps} in linguistics denotes a system of grammatically relevant contrasts wherein certain semantic concepts are divided into a small number of categories. In Modern English, gender is typically described as a three-way distinction (masculine/feminine/neuter) realized mainly on pronouns, and as referential rather than noun-class gender (Corbett 1991; Huddleston and Pullum 2002).

That description is right about what English isn't: there isn't noun-class gender on nouns in the way German, French, or Russian has it. It also captures the referential base of the system. Still, the usual pronoun-only framing misses two things: speakers treat violations as grammatical, and the same constraints show up across a wider semantic class of pro-forms, not just personal pronouns. That's where this paper intervenes.

A substantial body of work now exists on this referential system. Dahl (2000) reframes animacy hierarchies as a fuzzy person--non-person distinction, and Audring (2009) shows how pronominal systems resemanticize when agreement is borne primarily by pronouns. Variation work shows that the cut-off can shift: Siemund (2013) models dialectal differences in English pronominal gender as different thresholds on an individuation hierarchy. Diachronically, Kastovsky (2000) traces the dissolution of Old English grammatical gender, and Dolberg (2019) documents the transition from lexical to referential gender in the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* in fine detail.

These accounts share a common architecture: English gender is referential, hierarchically organized, and driven by properties of the designatum rather than the antecedent. They also share a common limitation: they keep the system's scope largely within third-person pronouns. Siemund and Dolberg (2011), for instance, state that in Modern English only third-person pronouns serve as gender exponents. This paper shows why that restriction is too narrow: the same personhood-based logic that governs *he*/*she*/*it* also governs *who*/*which*, *somebody*/*something*, and *when*/*where* -- in short, across the entire class of items that function semantically as pro-forms.

That the participants in this system form a semantic class rather than a syntactic category follows naturally from the semantic nature of the system itself: a designatum-driven gender system imposes constraints on how we conceptualize entities, not on their formal syntactic representation. I use [pro-form gender]{.smallcaps} for the English system in which lexical items that function semantically as pro-forms impose presuppositional constraints on a source designatum; selection is designatum-driven rather than antecedent-driven (see Section [3](#the-english-pro-form-gender-system) for the inventory and mechanics). English's referential gender system thus takes the specific form of pro-form gender, where constraints are lexicalized on items functioning as pro-forms rather than distributed through NP-internal concord. This stands apart from noun-class gender systems where assignment is fixed on nouns and agreement spreads through NP-internal morphology. One consequence of the pro-form framing is that the same lexeme may carry a gender constraint in one use but not another. When *which* is anaphoric (as in *the book which I read*), it presupposes a non-personal designatum. When *which* determines an overt head noun (as in *which person?*), no presupposition is imposed -- because the head noun, not *which*, establishes the designatum (see Section [4.3](#relative-pronouns)).

I show that Modern English exhibits a hierarchical gender system based primarily on attributed personhood, not biological sex. The system is centered on items functioning as pro-forms: personal pronouns, relative words (*who*, *which*, *when*, *where*), and determinatives (when they function as fused heads). Gender percolates beyond core pro-form uses to morphological relatives and semantic neighbors -- most notably to interrogatives (*who*, *what*), which participate in the gender system despite not being pro-forms -- reflecting the historical shift from noun-class to designatum-based gender. The central value distinction in this system is between personal and non-personal gender, with sexual gender (masculine/feminine) functioning as a subcategory of personal gender, and temporal and locative subtypes functioning as subcategories of non-personal gender. The distinction between temporal and locative pro-forms (e.g., *when* versus *where*) isn't importantly different in kind from the distinction between personal and non-personal pro-forms (e.g., *who* versus *which*) or between masculine and feminine pro-forms (e.g., *him* versus *her*) -- all are manifestations of the same underlying system. This hierarchical organization reveals systematic patterns previously obscured by traditional accounts of English gender.

The personal--non-personal distinction has been partially recognized in previous accounts, including typological work on animacy hierarchies (Dahl 2000). Huddleston and Pullum (2002) describe a personal--non-personal system at work in the contrast between relative pronouns *who* and *which*, while Quirk et al. (1985) use related terminology for pronouns; Halliday and Hasan (1976) highlight semantic specification in reference relations. Those accounts tend to keep the split secondary to the masculine--feminine--neuter triad, rather than making it the organizing principle.

The grammaticalized nature of this system shows up in minimal contrasts. When speakers produce sentences like *\*The doctor which I saw* or *\*The book who was on the table*, the violations are perceived as ungrammatical, comparable to agreement or complementation errors. That points to a grammar-level constraint even in a referential system, which aligns with broader work on pronominal gender in Germanic (Audring 2009; Siemund 2013).

Three guardrails will keep terms from slipping. First, [personal]{.smallcaps} is a discourse-level attribution of person-status, not a claim about metaphysical or legal personhood. A human can be treated non-personally in a given discourse move, and a non-human can be treated personally without invoking literal personhood. Second, I use [masculine]{.smallcaps}/[feminine]{.smallcaps} for grammatical labels and [male]{.smallcaps}/[female]{.smallcaps} for biological sex. When these come apart, I'll say so explicitly. Third, I use [personal]{.smallcaps} rather than [animate]{.smallcaps} because the system tracks attributed personhood, not biological animacy: most non-human animals pattern with inanimates (*it*) unless construed as persons in discourse.

Categorial determinations throughout follow *CGEL* unless otherwise noted; in particular, I distinguish the lexical category [determinative]{.smallcaps} from the syntactic function [determiner]{.smallcaps}.

Some readers may prefer a different cover term than "gender" for English. Alternatives like "pro-form concord" or "designatum-based agreement" capture the system's locus well. I stick with "gender" because it's the term used in reference grammars for the same distribution and because agreement-based definitions keep pronominal systems in scope (Unterbeck et al. 2000).

I remain agnostic about the formal representation of gender (e.g. the controller/target/conditions framework, the Index/Concord distinction, or the locus of gender);[^1] nothing here depends on those choices. The analysis rests only on a minimal set of assumptions: certain English lexical items -- many of them pro-forms in the semantic sense -- lexically encode a presuppositional constraint on the discourse designatum, drawn from [personal]{.smallcaps} and [non-personal]{.smallcaps}; when [personal]{.smallcaps} holds, a further [masculine]{.smallcaps}/[feminine]{.smallcaps} distinction may be realized, and within [non-personal]{.smallcaps}, [locative]{.smallcaps} and [temporal]{.smallcaps} are systematic subtypes.[^2] Anaphoric dependencies require chain-internal coherence of these constraints. This is enough to derive the core distributional facts (the *who*/*which* and *where*/*when* partitions, the personal restriction on singular *they*, and the neutrality of relative *whose*) and the observed limits on mixing within a single reference chain.

The analysis builds on well-known descriptions of English reference and "gender" while re-ordering what is primary. Huddleston and Pullum (2002) already treat *who* vs *which* as a personal--non-personal split, and Quirk et al. (1985) use related terminology for pronouns; Halliday and Hasan (1976) emphasizes semantic specification in reference relations; and Haspelmath (2001) documents the cross-linguistic ubiquity of *who*/*what*-type partitions in interrogatives and indefinites. Work on Germanic pronominal systems adds two further pieces: pronoun-only systems tend to resemanticize over time (Audring 2009), and dialect evidence shows personhood can compete with other semantic bases such as mass--count (Siemund 2013). What is new here is to elevate the personal--non-personal contrast to the organizing principle of the value hierarchy for English pro-forms in general, to treat [masculine]{.smallcaps}/[feminine]{.smallcaps} as a subdivision within the personal domain, and to integrate [locative]{.smallcaps}/[temporal]{.smallcaps} contrasts as systematic subtypes within the non-personal domain. A second shift is locus: for English specifically, the relevant constraints are carried by the lexical items that function semantically as pro-forms, and coherence is enforced across anaphora rather than by NP-internal concord.

This re-locates familiar facts (e.g. the *who*/*which* split, the personal restriction on singular *they*, the neutrality of relative *whose*) within a single system and adds two generalisations not made explicit in the standard accounts: (i) chain-internal coherence -- once a designatum is construed as personal or non-personal within a reference chain, mixing is restricted unless the discourse independently reclassifies it (e.g. personification or metonymy); and (ii) source-aligned genitives -- English genitive pro-forms track the possessor's conceptualization rather than the head noun, contrasting with languages whose genitives concord with the head.

The discussion concerns present-day Standard English in ordinary written and spoken registers, unless otherwise noted. I use constructed minimal pairs alongside widely attested patterns; examples are chosen to keep confounds to a minimum. Acceptability markers are used in the usual way ('\*' ungrammatical, '^?^' marginal, '^\#^' pragmatically odd), and I report contrasts rather than fine gradience. Terminology such as [personal]{.smallcaps}, [non-personal]{.smallcaps}, [epicene]{.smallcaps}, [sexual]{.smallcaps}, [locative]{.smallcaps}, and [temporal]{.smallcaps} is descriptive and will be used consistently in what follows.

The paper is organized as follows. Section [2](#personhood-and-gender) discusses the concept of personhood as it relates to gender in English. Section [3](#the-english-pro-form-gender-system) outlines the proposed hierarchical gender system -- including the subcategorization of personal gender into epicene and sexual types, and non-personal gender into temporal and locative types -- and provides the criteria for categorizing words within it. The remaining sections examine how this system is realized across different lexical categories: Section [4](#pronouns-in-the-gender-system) covers pronouns, Section [5](#determinatives-in-the-gender-system) covers determinatives, and Section [6](#other-pro-forms-in-the-gender-system) extends the analysis to other pro-forms such as prepositions and manner adverbs. Section [7](#remaining-challenges-and-inconsistencies) addresses remaining challenges and inconsistencies. Section [8](#conclusion) concludes with implications for our understanding of English grammar and directions for further research.

# 2 Personhood and gender

If we have, as Curzan (2003) argues, a natural gender system in English, and if that system has a personal gender, then personhood itself becomes critical to our understanding of grammatical structure. In this section, I explore the concept of personhood as it relates to English gender, establishing a philosophical foundation for the linguistic analysis that follows.

## 2.1 Philosophical conceptions of personhood

A brief philosophical sketch helps fix the sense of personhood at issue. Dennett (1976) distinguishes between metaphysical personhood and moral personhood, what Perring (1997) calls descriptive and normative uses of the term. The philosophical distinction is useful because it separates personhood from humanness, but the grammatical category here tracks speakers' attributions, not metaphysical facts.

Dennett lists six conditions of personhood: persons are (1) rational beings (2) to which states of consciousness are attributed (3) who are treated as persons by other persons (4) and who reciprocate this treatment. They are (5) capable of verbal communication (6) and conscious, specifically self-conscious. He argues that these conditions are mutually interdependent, with the sixth being the most dependent on the others. There seems to be general agreement on the overall list, leading most philosophers to the position that a person is roughly one who can consider themself as themself (Baker 2000).

For philosophers, the term [person]{.smallcaps} isn't, therefore, synonymous with [human]{.smallcaps} because some humans can't consider themselves as themselves and because non-human beings may possibly be able to do so. Kuhse and Singer (1985), for example, argue that newborn infants aren't persons, and various philosophers are prepared to argue for the personhood of animals, though such positions tend towards arguments for seeing animals as moral (Aaltola 2008) or legal persons (Bilchitz 2009).

## 2.2 Personhood versus animacy

Many analyses of gender make an animate--inanimate distinction (Luraghi 2011). In Modern English, I use [personal]{.smallcaps} rather than [animate]{.smallcaps} because the pronoun system doesn't align with animacy: most non-human animates pattern with inanimates unless the speaker attributes person-status, and some inanimates can be treated personally in the right discourse frame. Default usage makes no grammatical split between dogs, trees, and rocks; all take *it* unless the discourse frames them as persons. The system is organized around personhood attribution, not biological animacy.

Consider the following examples:

+-------+-------+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| \(1\) | > a\. | *A dog saw itself in the mirror.*       | > \[animate, non-personal\]  |
+=======+=======+=========================================+=============================:+
|       | b\.   | *A sensor sensed itself in the mirror.* | \[inanimate, non-personal\]  |
+-------+-------+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------+
|       | > c\. | *A child saw herself in the mirror.*    | \[animate, personal\]        |
+-------+-------+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------+

Here and throughout, [personal]{.smallcaps} is a discourse-level attribution of person-status. It doesn't require metaphysical personhood, and it isn't identical to humanness or animacy. Table [1](#tab:personhood) sketches typical defaults rather than hard rules; the point is that humanness and animacy are neither necessary nor sufficient for personal gender.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  Designatum (context)    Human?   Animate?      Typical pro-form
  ---------------------- -------- ---------- ------------------------
  Adult human              yes       yes             personal

  Infant (sex unknown)     yes       yes      personal--non-personal

  Pet (family member)       no       yes      personal--non-personal

  Corporation or team       no        no      personal--non-personal

  Tool or desk              no        no           non-personal
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  : []{#tab:personhood .anchor}Table 1: Personhood attribution is independent of humanness and animacy (illustrative defaults).

The examples in (1) illustrate that animacy alone can't explain the distribution of pronoun usage in English. Dogs are animate but typically take non-personal pronouns like *it* rather than *he* or *she* unless the discourse construes them as personal. The critical factor is whether the referent is construed as personal in context.

## 2.3 Personhood in everyday conceptualization

Everyday conceptions of personhood align remarkably well with the patterns observed in English gender usage. Waytz et al. (2010) show that individuals vary in their general propensity to attribute characteristics such as intentionality, emotions, and consciousness to pets, fish, clouds, robots, cars, and other non-human entities. Not only does this propensity vary between individuals, but entities differ in the degrees to which people are willing to ascribe personhood to them.

This explains several otherwise puzzling patterns in English usage:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \(2\)   *It's so cute!*                                     \[referring to a baby\]
  ------- ---------------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  \(3\)   *The ship lost her mast in the storm.*     \[conventional personification\]

  \(4\)   *Who's a good boy? Yes, you are.*            \[personal gender with a pet\]
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In (2a), an infant may be referred to with the non-personal pronoun *it*, especially when the infant's sex is unknown (McConnell-Ginet 2014). That usage doesn't deny personhood; it reflects a temporary withholding of person-status or a focus on non-personal properties. Example (b) demonstrates conventional personification with vehicles or vessels, while (c) shows a pet construed as personal in discourse.

Shir-Vertesh (2012) demonstrates that pets are often viewed as persons but that these views are flexible and can change quickly with the situation. She concludes, "animals in the families I researched may be treated as 'persons' at times, yet they are never accepted as actual humans; rather, they serve a flexible function in terms of the human role they play" (429). This flexibility in conceptualization is mirrored in our pronoun usage with pets.

## 2.4 Personhood and pro-form gender

Given these philosophical and psychological foundations, we can now better understand the structure of the English gender system. The personal gender in English designates entities that are construed as persons in discourse; the philosophical sense supplies a reference point, not a requirement. The non-personal gender designates entities that aren't construed as persons in the current discourse frame.

This approach explains several key facts about English gender:

1.  Typical humans are prototypical persons and consistently take personal gender.

2.  Other humans, such as infants, may occasionally take non-personal forms when speakers withhold person-status, when sex is unknown, or when the discourse foregrounds non-personal properties.

3.  Non-humans, such as pets or anthropomorphized objects, may take personal forms when they are construed as personal.

4.  The flexibility of our conception of personhood explains the variability in gender assignment for borderline cases.

This personhood-based account helps distinguish the English system from noun-class systems like German while keeping room for the fact that German pronouns can still track referential properties. English lacks noun-class gender on nouns, but it does have grammatical constraints across pro-forms.

## 2.5 Sexual gender within personal gender

Within the personal gender category, English makes a further grammatical distinction between masculine and feminine, which I call [sexual gender]{.smallcaps}. I use [masculine]{.smallcaps}/[feminine]{.smallcaps} for grammatical values and [male]{.smallcaps}/[female]{.smallcaps} for biological sex. The mapping is prototypical rather than deterministic, and it's mediated by social gender (Curzan 2003; Romaine 1998).

The sexual-gender split is cognitively basic, which shows up in how learners approach it. Learners still confuse *he* and *she*, but the distinction doesn't require the kind of arbitrary lexeme-by-lexeme learning that noun-class systems do. That contrast is one reason English learners generally find sex-based pronominal gender easier than grammatical gender systems like German.

From the perspective of English grammatical gender, only personal designata have sexual gender. In ordinary usage, animals are often referred to as *it* unless they're individuated or personified, though specialist registers (e.g. ornithology) may use *he*/*she* for sexed animals. A country can be *she*, but only when it's construed as a person in discourse, as in the following examples from Huddleston and Pullum (2002, 488):

+-------+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| \(5\) | > a\. | *This country~i~ has no sense of her~i~*/*its~i~ place in the world.*                             |
+=======+=======+===================================================================================================+
|       | b\.   | *From this map of England~i~, you can see that it~i~*/\**she~i~ lies north of the 50th parallel.* |
+-------+-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In ([5](#ex:country)a), the country is construed as an intentional agent in discourse. In (b), it's treated as a geographic object. This illustrates how the sexual-gender distinction operates only within the domain of personal gender, rather than independently.

This hierarchical organization, where sexual gender is a subdivision of personal gender rather than a parallel system, is a distinctive feature of the English gender system that hasn't been adequately recognized.

# 3 The English pro-form-gender system

In what follows, [pro-form]{.smallcaps} is used semantically (pronouns, certain *wh*-items, and a subset of determinatives), and [source]{.smallcaps} names the designatum that fixes their lexical constraints (cf. (Trask 1992, 15)). For example, in *I saw Margaret and she was in good spirits*, Margaret, the person designated by *she* and the name *Margaret*, serves as the source, requiring the pro-form *she*. Similarly, in *I prefer being here, where it's cool*, the location where the utterance designated by *here* and *where* is made functions as a non-personal-locative source, necessitating the pro-form *where*. This relationship between source and pro-form is fundamental to understanding gender concord in English, as it's the semantic nature of the source -- not its grammatical form -- that establishes the gender constraints a pro-form has to satisfy.

The locus of the constraint in English is lexical: items that function semantically as pro-forms conventionally require that their source/designatum be construed as [personal]{.smallcaps} or [non-personal]{.smallcaps}; within [personal]{.smallcaps}, a further [masculine]{.smallcaps}/[feminine]{.smallcaps} split is available; within [non-personal]{.smallcaps}, [locative]{.smallcaps} and [temporal]{.smallcaps} are systematic subtypes. The noun phrase's internal form doesn't force these values in English; rather, once a discourse entity is construed one way, anaphora enforces chain-internal coherence of that construal unless the discourse independently reclassifies the entity (e.g. personification or metonymy). This perspective brings under one roof the *who*/*which* split, the personal restriction on singular *they*, the neutrality of relative *whose*, *where*/*when* versus *which* alternations under different conceptualizations of the same nominal, and the fact that English genitives align with the possessor's conceptualization rather than with the head noun.

## 3.1 Designatum versus referent and antecedent

Before proceeding, it's important to clarify that the system described here concerns a word's designatum, not necessarily its referent or antecedent. The [designatum]{.smallcaps} is the entity designated by a linguistic term, while a [referent]{.smallcaps} is "some independently distinguishable entity, or set of entities, in the real world" (Huddleston and Pullum 2002, 399). An [antecedent]{.smallcaps} is the "constituent whose meaning dictates the meaning of a pronoun or other such expression in cases of anaphora" (Huddleston et al. 2021, 295).

This distinction is crucial for understanding pro-form gender assignment in English for several reasons. A pro-form need not have an antecedent to participate in the gender system. Pro-forms such as *you* (e.g., *I can't remember how you spell it*), *one* (e.g., *what is one to do?*), or *someone* may be the only constituent in an NP that designates a person, even though they have neither referent nor antecedent.

The designatum need not be a token, but may be a type, as long as the speaker considers the type to be of the relevant category. For example, the NP in *the typical politician isn't to be trusted* designates a type of person, not a person, but the gender would still be personal.

The semantic nature of the system is particularly evident in cases of what Wu (2025) terms [discorded referential metonymy]{.smallcaps}. See also Warren (2004). Consider:

(6) *The French fries*~i~ *is waiting. She*~i~ *is upset.* (Wu 2025: p. 5)

Here, an NP with a default non-personal reading (*the French fries*) is used to invoke a customer; subsequent anaphora tracks that metonymic designatum, yielding personal--feminine *she*. The antecedent's form (plural, non-personal) doesn't control the pro-form; the conceptualized source does (see Section [4](#pronouns-in-the-gender-system) on possessor-aligned genitives).

This contrasts sharply with grammatical-gender languages like Spanish, French, German, and Russian, wherein the antecedent is the chief controller of gender.[^3] In such languages, NP-internal concord is far less flexible, even if pronouns sometimes allow referential overrides. As a result, the equivalent attempt at metonymy for a male customer would either be pragmatically odd ([6](#ex:Spanish)a) or ungrammatical due to gender violation (b). To overcome these issues, something like a rephrasing with a common noun such as *the gentleman* (c), rather than a pronoun, would be needed.

(6) a\. ^\#^ *Las patatas fritas*~i~ *esperan. Ellas*~i~ *están enfadadas.*

> def.f.pl potato.f.pl fried.f.pl wait.3pl pres. 3pl.f be.3pl pres angry.f.pl

## 3.2 The hierarchical structure

Figure [1](#fig:hierarchy) lays out the hierarchy itself: [personal]{.smallcaps} splits into [epicene]{.smallcaps} and [sexual]{.smallcaps}; [sexual]{.smallcaps} splits into [masculine]{.smallcaps} and [feminine]{.smallcaps}; [non-personal]{.smallcaps} splits into [general]{.smallcaps}, [locative]{.smallcaps}, and [temporal]{.smallcaps}. Table [2](#tab:one) lists representative exponents. The leftmost column contains gender-neutral pro-forms that don't encode the personal--non-personal contrast; the remaining columns list gender-sensitive items.

: Table 2: The pro-form-gender system of English.

[]{#tab:one .anchor}As the layout of Table [2](#tab:one) suggests, each gender subtype inherits the properties of its parent gender. For example, that a word has feminine gender entails that it has sexual gender, which, in turn, entails personal gender.

## 3.3 Gender neutral versus gender sensitive

At the level of exponents, the first distinction is between gender-neutral pro-forms (imposing no presuppositional constraint) and gender-sensitive pro-forms (which do). Within the gender-sensitive domain, the primary semantic distinction is personal--non-personal. Almost all pronouns are gender sensitive, the four exceptions being plural *they*, relative *whose*, and the reflexive pronouns *each other* and *one another*. Epicene pronouns are gender sensitive because they still encode the personal--non-personal split even when they don't encode sexual gender. The difference between plural, gender-neutral *they* and singular, gender-sensitive *they* in ([8](#ex:they)) illustrates the difference.

+-------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| \(8\) | > a\. | *There are some people~i~. They~i~ are very tall.* | \[pl, personal\]     |
+=======+=======+====================================================+=====================:+
|       | b\.   | *There are some people~i~. They~i~ are very tall.* | \[pl, non-personal\] |
+-------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
|       | c\.   | *There's a person~i~. They~i~ are very tall.*      | \[sg, personal\]     |
+-------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+----------------------+
|       | d\.   | *There's a tree~i~.* \**They~i~ are very tall.*    | \[sg, non-personal\] |
+-------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+----------------------+

While plural *they* in ([8](#ex:they)a) and (b) is grammatical as the pro-form of NPs of any gender, singular *they* in (c) is only grammatical with personal sources as in (c). The ungrammatical example in (d) shows that singular *they* can't be used with non-personal sources (cf. (Bjorkman 2017; Konnelly and Cowper 2020)).

The *Oxford English Dictionary* distinguishes the plural sense (I.1) from a singular anaphoric sense (I.2); the glossary renders the latter as "In anaphoric reference to a singular noun or pronoun of undetermined gender: he or she", illustrated with person-only examples such as "When somebody becomes prime minister they're immediately put on a pedestal" (*Glossary of Grammatical Terms* n.d.).

## 3.4 The personal--non-personal distinction

Among gender-sensitive pro-forms, the next distinction is between the personal gender and the non-personal gender. Similar distinctions are quite common across languages. Haspelmath (2001) notes that

> the distinction between human and non-human referents is made practically everywhere ('who' vs. 'what', 'somebody' vs. 'something'), even in languages where humanness isn't very prominent elsewhere in the grammar. Languages that assign a prominent role to other gender distinctions in their grammar (e.g. sex-based gender) nevertheless usually make the human/non-human distinction here (34--35).

I am using [personal--non-personal]{.smallcaps} rather than "human--non-human" or "animate--inanimate" because, as established in Section [2](#personhood-and-gender), the English system tracks personhood attribution, not humanness or animacy. It might be worth re-evaluating languages with a purported human--non-human distinction to see whether a person--non-person distinction might be more appropriate.

### 3.4.1 Non-personal gender

Words with non-personal gender designate entities that aren't construed as persons. These include:

1.  The pronoun *it*

2.  The temporal pro-forms *today*, *tomorrow*, *tonight*, and *yesterday*

3.  The determinatives *much*, *little*, and *a little*

4.  The compound determinatives *once*, *twice*, and *thrice*

5.  The compound determinatives with *-thing* and *-where* (e.g., *something* or *anywhere*)

6.  The relative pronouns *which* and *what* and the interrogative pronoun *what*

### 3.4.2 Personal gender

Words with personal gender designate entities construed as persons in discourse, as outlined in Section [2](#personhood-and-gender). These include:

1.  First-person pronouns: *I*, *we*

2.  Second-person pronouns: *you*

3.  Third-person pronouns: *he*, *she*, singular *they*

4.  The pronoun *one*

5.  The relative pronoun *who* and interrogative pronouns *who* and *whose*

6.  The compound determinatives with *-body* and *-one* (e.g., *nobody*, *anyone*)

## 3.5 Epicene versus sexual genders

The personal genders break down into [epicene]{.smallcaps} and [sexual]{.smallcaps}. This distinction has sometimes been lost, perhaps because it appears to be confounded with the systems of person and number. First- and second-person singular pronouns can refer to any person, regardless of sex or social gender, as can all plural pronouns. Only third-person, singular pronouns distinguish between masculine and feminine.

But interrogative and relative *who* are epicene, singular, third-person pronouns, showing that the difference can't simply be left to the systems of person or number. The epicene pronouns, therefore, include *I*, *we*, *you*, singular *they*, *one*, *who*, *whom*, and interrogative -- but not relative -- *whose*.

All of these pronouns are also used when non-humans are construed as personal. For example, there are many everyday interactions with pets using the second-person pronoun (e.g., *do you want to go for a walk?*). And so Wales (1996) goes too far when she claims that "personification is really sexification" (147). The flexible nature of our ideas of persons also permeates the epicene gender. Even the pronoun *one* can be used for non-human persons, as in ([9](#ex:one)).

> \(9\) *There appears to be a certain amount of learning in losing one's tail; researchers in California found that once a young skink has had a close encounter of the near-fatal kind it seems to be more cautious.* (Anderson 2008)

[]{#ex:one .anchor}The determinative *one* (e.g., *one boy*/*box*; *I have one*), unlike the pronoun, is gender neutral.

## 3.6 The sexual genders

Finally, there are the sexual genders, [masculine]{.smallcaps} and [feminine]{.smallcaps}, each with only one lexeme, the feminine pronoun *she*, and the masculine pronoun *he*. As established in Section [2](#personhood-and-gender), the choice between masculine and feminine is based mostly on biological sex, though other factors come in to play. Sociocultural factors and related linguistic practices concerning gender-queer persons represent further relevant considerations (Zimman 2017).

## 3.7 Summary of the system

To summarize, the English pro-form-gender system is hierarchically organized with the following levels:

1.  Gender-neutral versus gender-sensitive pro-forms

2.  Among gender-sensitive pro-forms: personal versus non-personal gender

3.  Among personal pro-forms: epicene versus sexual gender

4.  Among sexual pro-forms: masculine versus feminine gender

This system captures important generalizations about the distribution of pro-forms in English and provides a more accurate model of gender than the traditional masculine-feminine-neuter pronoun triad.

Having established the semantic architecture of the system, the following sections examine how it is realized across different lexical categories. Section [4](#pronouns-in-the-gender-system) begins with pronouns, the central exponents of the system; Section [5](#determinatives-in-the-gender-system) turns to determinatives, which participate in gender when they function as pro-forms; and Section [6](#other-pro-forms-in-the-gender-system) extends the analysis to other pro-forms, including prepositions and manner adverbs.

# 4 Pronouns in the gender system

Huddleston and Pullum (2002) emphasize pronouns as the primary exponents of English gender, and they are indeed central to the system, showing the clearest and most consistent patterns. Still, a wider examination reveals that the system extends beyond pronouns. Diachronic work also suggests that NP-external exponents lead change while NP-internal exponents lag behind (Siemund and Dolberg 2011), and cross-Germanic research shows pronoun-only systems tend to resemanticize over time (Audring 2009). This section examines the role of different pronoun types within the hierarchical gender framework established in Section [3](#the-english-pro-form-gender-system).

## 4.1 Personal pronouns

Here, extitperson names the grammatical category (first/second/third), not personhood as a semantic construal of the referent; the two are independent dimensions.

The term [personal pronoun]{.smallcaps} typically refers to pronouns "with the principal function of distinguishing among individuals in terms of the deictic category of person" (Trask 1992, 206). In English, this includes the first-person *I* and *we*, second-person *you*, and third-person *he*, *she*, *they*, *it*, and *one*.

Within the gender framework proposed here, these pronouns distribute across the categories as follows:

1.  Gender neutral: Plural *they*

2.  Non-personal gender: *it*

3.  Personal-epicene gender: *I*, *we*, *you*, singular *they*, *one*

4.  Personal-sexual-masculine gender: *he*

5.  Personal-sexual-feminine gender: *she*

### 4.1.1 First and second person

The first-person pronouns *I* and *we* and the second-person pronoun *you* are always epicene in gender. They refer to persons regardless of sex or gender identity, and they can only designate entities construed as personal.

> \(10\) *The rock claimed, "I'm ancient."* \[requires personification\]

[]{#ex:person1 .anchor}Example ([10](#ex:person1)) illustrates that using such pronouns for non-persons requires personification.

Occasionally, first- and second-person pronouns appear to designate non-persons, as in ([11](#ex:person2)):

> \(11\) *You stupid printer! Why won't you work?*

But these are cases of anthropomorphism or personification -- the speaker is temporarily treating the printer or rocks as if they were persons capable of understanding and responding. This isn't a counterexample to the personal gender of these pronouns but rather evidence of our flexible attribution of personhood, as discussed in Section [2](#personhood-and-gender).

### 4.1.2 Third-person pronouns

The third-person pronouns show the most varied gender distributions:

1.  *It* is default non-personal. It can still be used for human designata when person-status is withheld or backgrounded (e.g. infants, dehumanizing contexts).

2.  *He* and *she* are personal-sexual, designating persons of masculine and feminine gender respectively.

3.  Singular *they* and *one* are personal-epicene, designating persons regardless of gender.

4.  Plural *they* is gender-neutral, designating both persons and non-persons.

The pronoun *it* shows an interesting contrast with the other third-person pronouns. Consider:

+--------+-------+-------------------------------------------------+------------------------+
| \(12\) | > a\. | *The baby was crying because it was hungry.*    | \[non-personal\]       |
+========+=======+=================================================+=======================:+
|        | b\.   | *The baby was crying because she was hungry.*   | \[personal-feminine\]  |
+--------+-------+-------------------------------------------------+------------------------+
|        | > c\. | *The baby was crying because they were hungry.* | > \[personal-epicene\] |
+--------+-------+-------------------------------------------------+------------------------+

Examples ([12](#ex:it)a--c) show that the same referent -- a baby -- can be conceptualized either as a person (with *she* or singular *they*) or as a non-person (with *it*). This flexibility aligns with the idea that personhood attributions are graded and context-sensitive; it's not a claim about infants' moral status.

The fact that *it* is non-personal rather than "neutral" is presumably why it hasn't enjoyed use as a "non-binary pronoun" and thus why singular *they* has.

The pronoun *one* deserves special mention as it functions as a generic personal pronoun. Unlike most other pronouns, it typically lacks a specific referent. In ([13](#ex:one2)), for instance, *one* designates persons in general.

> \(13\) *One should always be polite.*

## 4.2 Genitive pronouns as source-driven pro-forms

Genitive pronouns provide particularly clear evidence for the source-driven nature of the pro-form gender system. Unlike some languages (such as French) where genitive pronouns agree with the syntactic head noun, English genitive pro-forms agree exclusively with their semantic source -- the possessor:

+------------------------------+-------+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| []{#ex:genitive .anchor}(14) | > a\. | *It fell on its owner.*    | \[non-pers source, pers head\]                |
+==============================+=======+============================+===================+==========================:+
|                              | b\.   | *Her brother is younger.*  | \[fem source, masc head\]                     |
+------------------------------+-------+----------------------------+-------------------+---------------------------+
| \(15\)                       |       | *Son frère est plus jeune*.\                   | \[fem source, masc head\] |
|                              |       | gen.m brother.m be.3sg more young\             |                           |
|                              |       | *Her brother is younger.*                      |                           |
+------------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+

In ([14](#ex:genitive)), the genitive pro-forms (*its*, *her*) derive their gender values entirely from their sources (the possessors), regardless of the gender of the head noun. This pattern holds across all genitive forms in English and provides strong evidence for the directional relationship between source and pro-form posited in this analysis.[^4]

In the French ([15](#ex:genitive)), *son* agrees with the masculine head noun *frère* ('brother'), despite referring to a female possessor, contrasting with English *her*, which reflects the possessor's gender.

## 4.3 Relative pronouns

The relative pronouns in English display a clear division along the personal--non-personal line:

1.  *Who* and *whom* have personal gender

2.  *Which* and *what*[^5] have non-personal gender

3.  *Whose* is gender-neutral, as in ([16](#ex:whose-cover))

> []{#ex:whose-cover .anchor}(16) *the person*/*book whose story is well known*

The contrast between *who* and *which* provides perhaps the clearest evidence for the personal--non-personal distinction in English grammar:

+--------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| \(17\) | > a\. | *The woman who*/\**which lives there is a doctor.* | \[personal\]     |
+========+=======+====================================================+=================:+
|        | b\.   | *The tree which*/\**who stands there is an oak.*   | \[non-personal\] |
+--------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+------------------+

The ungrammaticality of *which* in ([17](#ex:relative)a) and *who* in ([17](#ex:relative)b) demonstrates that these relative pro-forms are sensitive to the personal status of their sources. These aren't lexical idiosyncrasies but the visible edges of the personal/non-personal partition.

There are, however, some complex cases involving *which* or *who* that warrant closer examination:

\(18\) a. *That's the dog*~i~ *who*~i~ *attacked his*~i~ *owner.*

b\. *That's the dog*~i~ *which*~i~ *attacked its*~i~ *owner.*

c\. ^?^ *That's the dog*~i~ *which*~i~ *attacked his*~i~ *owner.*

d\. ^?^ *That's the dog*~i~ *who*~i~ *attacked its*~i~ *owner.*

In ([18](#ex:which)), the source is a dog. Example (a) illustrates a personal conceptualization, with both *who* and *his* reflecting the speaker's treatment of the dog as a person. Example (b) shows a non-personal conceptualization, with both *which* and *its* treating the dog as a non-person.

The questionable status of (c) and (d) suggests constraints on mixing personal and non-personal elements within the same reference chain. The pattern in ([18](#ex:which)) illustrates the general chain-coherence effect: once a designatum is construed as personal (or non-personal) within a reference chain, mixing personal and non-personal morphology is disfavoured unless there is an independent cue to reclassification in the discourse.

The fact that determinative *which* is gender-neutral while pronominal *which* is non-personal follows directly from the pro-form analysis: only items functioning as pro-forms carry gender constraints. When *which* determines an overt head noun, no presupposition is imposed on the designatum.

\(19\) *Tell me which person you want to invite.*

### 4.3.1 Alternative conceptualizations and pro-form selection

A particularly revealing case of how conceptualization affects pro-form selection occurs when the same source can work for different pro-forms based on how it's conceptualized:

+-------------------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------+-------------------------+
| []{#ex:room-conception .anchor}(20) | > a\. | > *the room where the painting was done* | \[room as location\]    |
+=====================================+=======+==========================================+========================:+
|                                     | b\.   | > *the room which was painted*           | > \[room as patient\]   |
+-------------------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------+-------------------------+

In ([20](#ex:room-conception)a), *room* is conceptualized as a location where an action occurred, requiring the non-personal-locative pro-form *where*. In contrast, (b) conceptualizes the same entity as a patient of the action, requiring the non-personal pro-form *which*. This demonstrates that pro-form selection is sensitive not merely to the inherent properties of the source, but to how the source is being conceptualized in a particular discourse context.

Similar alternations can be observed with temporal references:

+--------+-------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| \(21\) | > a\. | *the moment when we met*              | > \[moment as time\]     |
+========+=======+=======================================+=========================:+
|        | b\.   | *the moment which changed everything* | \[moment as cause\]      |
+--------+-------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------+

These examples underscore that the gender system in English operates at the level of conceptualization rather than being rigidly determined by the inherent properties of entities.

## 4.4 Interrogative pronouns

The interrogative pronouns pattern similarly to the relative pronouns with respect to gender:

1.  *Who* and interrogative *whose* have personal gender

2.  *What* has non-personal gender

This distinction is illustrated in ([22](#ex:interrogative)):

+--------+-------+---------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| \(22\) | > a\. | > *Who is coming to the party?*       | \[asking about persons\]     |
+========+=======+=======================================+=============================:+
|        | b\.   | > *What is on the table?*             | \[asking about non-persons\] |
+--------+-------+---------------------------------------+------------------------------+
|        | > c\. | \* *Who is on the table?*             | \[asking about non-persons\] |
+--------+-------+---------------------------------------+------------------------------+
|        | d\.   | \* *What is coming to the party?*     | \[asking about persons\]     |
+--------+-------+---------------------------------------+------------------------------+

Examples (c) and (d) are grammatical only if the speaker is asking about a person on the table or a non-person coming to the party, respectively. This confirms that the personal--non-personal distinction is operative in the interrogative pronoun system.

When a speaker doesn't know whether the answer to their question will be a person or a non-person, they need to select the appropriate interrogative based on their expectations:

+--------+-------+----------------------------------+----------------------------+
| \(23\) | > a\. | *Who made that noise?*           | \[expecting a person\]     |
+========+=======+==================================+===========================:+
|        | b\.   | *What made that noise?*          | \[expecting a non-person\] |
+--------+-------+----------------------------------+----------------------------+

And so, even when the actual answer is unknown, the choice of interrogative pronoun reveals the speaker's conceptualization of the potential designatum as either a person or a non-person.

## 4.5 Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns

Like most other pronouns, reflexives (*myself*, *yourself*, etc.) inherit the gender of their source:

+--------+-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+
| \(24\) | > a\. | *John saw himself in the mirror.*       | \[personal-masculine\]  |
+========+=======+=========================================+========================:+
|        | b\.   | *Mary saw herself in the mirror.*       | > \[personal-feminine\] |
+--------+-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+
|        | > c\. | *The child saw themself in the mirror.* | \[personal-epicene\]    |
+--------+-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+
|        | > d\. | *The dog saw itself in the mirror.*     | \[non-personal\]        |
+--------+-------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+

The reciprocal pronouns *each other* and *one another*, though, are gender-neutral:

+--------+-------+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| \(25\) | > a\. | *The men gave each other gifts.*     | \[personal antecedent\]     |
+========+=======+======================================+============================:+
|        | b\.   | *The magnets attracted each other.*  | \[non-personal antecedent\] |
+--------+-------+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

In both ([25](#ex:reciprocal)a) and ([25](#ex:reciprocal)b), the reciprocal pronoun *each other* is acceptable regardless of whether its antecedent designates persons or non-persons. This places reciprocal pronouns in the gender-neutral category.

## 4.6 Temporal pro-forms

*CGEL* classifies *today*, *tomorrow*, *tonight*, and *yesterday* as pronouns on semantic and distributional grounds (Huddleston and Pullum 2002). I don't rely on that label: what matters is their pro-form function. These pro-forms are anchored to speech time rather than to a nominal antecedent, which is exactly why they pattern as non-personal in the present system.

> \(26\) a. *Tomorrow will be sunny.*

b\. *Today has been difficult.*

[]{#ex:temporal .anchor}In ([26](#ex:temporal)a) and ([26](#ex:temporal)b), the temporal pro-forms designate periods of time, i.e., non-personal designata.

## 4.7 Dummy pronouns

The expletive or dummy pronoun *it* in constructions like *it's raining* or *it seems that\...* has no designatum at all and so doesn't participate in the gender system. Similarly, the dummy subject *there* in existential constructions like *there is a book on the table* has no designatum and thus no gender.

## 4.8 Summary of pronoun gender

The full distribution of pronouns in Table [2](#tab:one) reveals several important patterns:

1.  Most pronouns are gender-sensitive rather than gender-neutral

2.  The personal--non-personal distinction is fundamental

3.  First- and second-person pronouns are always personal-epicene

4.  Third-person pronouns show the greatest variety of gender values

5.  The sexual genders (masculine and feminine) are limited to third-person singular pronouns

These patterns support the hierarchical gender system proposed in this paper, with its primary division between gender-neutral and gender-sensitive words, and its secondary division between personal and non-personal words.

# 5 Determinatives in the gender system

Although Huddleston and Pullum (2002) and other grammars describe English gender as being "based purely on pronoun agreement" (486), the foregoing analysis should make it clear that a number of determinatives are also involved in the gender system. This section examines determinatives and their participation in gender distinctions, providing evidence that the pro-form-gender system extends beyond pronouns.

The fact that both determinatives and pronouns participate in the gender system doesn't imply that they constitute a single lexical category. As demonstrated in Reynolds (2021), quantitative analysis using energy-distance statistics provides strong evidence that determinatives and pronouns form distinct lexical categories despite their shared participation in the gender system. The clustering analysis showed a 93.48% correspondence between the categories established in Huddleston and Pullum (2002) and those derived through unsupervised learning algorithms, with an adjusted agreement of 86.96%. The mean distance between determinatives and pronouns was 11.67 times greater than the mean distance within each category, a statistically significant difference ($p = 0.001$).

This statistical support for the categorical distinction between determinatives and pronouns indicates that shared participation in the gender system reflects a grammatical phenomenon that cuts across lexical categories rather than suggesting that these words belong to a single syntactic category. In other words, the gender system operates on both determinatives and pronouns, but this shared property doesn't override the substantial morphological, syntactic, and semantic differences that justify their classification as separate lexical categories.

## 5.1 Determiners versus determinatives

Following Huddleston and Pullum (2002), a distinction is made between the syntactic function of [determiner]{.smallcaps} and the lexical category of [determinative]{.smallcaps}. A word like *more* is a determinative whether it functions as determiner in an NP with a noun as its head (e.g., *more people stayed*), as a fused determiner--head (e.g., *more stayed*), or as a modifier (e.g., *more important*) (Reynolds 2024).

The gender system is [pro-form-centered]{.smallcaps}: its clearest and most systematic manifestations occur where determinatives function semantically as pro-forms, taking their interpretation anaphorically or deictically rather than from an overt nominal head. This typically occurs in fused-head constructions where the determinative stands alone (e.g., *something fell*, *everyone left*, *few complained*), rather than when the determinative determines an overt head noun (e.g., *some people*, *few children*). In the latter case, the head noun establishes the designatum directly, and the determinative doesn't function as a pro-form. Examples like *some people* versus *some books* tell us nothing about gender -- in both cases, *some* isn't functioning as a pro-form. By contrast, *some* in *Some arrived late* does function as a pro-form, and its gender properties (in this case, neutrality) become relevant.

But the system isn't [pro-form-exclusive]{.smallcaps}. Gender percolates beyond strict pro-form function to morphological relatives and semantic neighbors. The personal determinatives *we* and *you* illustrate this: they impose personhood constraints on their head nouns even when functioning in determiner position (e.g., *we linguists*, *you children*). Unlike typical determinatives that merely quantify or specify, *we* and *you* carry inherent person deixis that restricts the type of head noun they can take. This percolation reflects their morphological identity with personal pronouns and their semantic proximity to pro-form uses. Given the history of English gender -- the gradual shift from a noun-class system to a designatum-based pronominal system -- such percolation is expected rather than surprising.

This pro-form-centered (but not exclusive) architecture has important consequences for the analysis that follows. Gender distinctions are clearest and most systematic where items function as pro-forms, but the system's effects can extend to morphologically or semantically related uses.

## 5.2 Personal determinatives

### 5.2.1 We and you as determinatives

The clearest cases of gendered determinatives are *we* and *you*, what Lyons (1999) calls "personal determiners" (note that "personal" here refers to the category of person (first, second, third), not to the personal gender). These determinatives can function as determiners in NPs with nominal heads:

> []{#ex:personal-det .anchor}(27) a. *We linguists need to be more precise.*

b\. *You children should go to bed.*

In ([27](#ex:personal-det)), the determinatives *we* and *you* are strictly personal in gender, just like their pronominal counterparts. They can't determine non-personal head nouns:

[]{#ex:personal-det2 .anchor} Examples ([28](#ex:personal-det2)a) and (b) are only acceptable with personification, reinforcing the personal gender of these determinatives.

+--------+-------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| \(28\) | > a\. | \* *We rocks have existed for many years.* | \[without personification\] |
+========+=======+============================================+============================:+
|        | b\.   | \* *You trees are blocking my view.*       | \[without personification\] |
+--------+-------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

### 5.2.2 Compound determinatives with -body and -one

The compound determinatives formed with *-body* and *-one* are clearly personal in gender, applying to all and only persons:

+--------+-------+-------------------------------------+----------------------------+
| \(29\) | > a\. | > *Everybody in the room stood up.* | \[personal\]               |
+========+=======+=====================================+===========================:+
|        | b\.   | > *Someone left their coat.*        | \[personal\]               |
+--------+-------+-------------------------------------+----------------------------+
|        | > c\. | \* *Somebody fell off the table.*   | \[referring to an object\] |
+--------+-------+-------------------------------------+----------------------------+

[]{#ex:body-one .anchor}Example ([29](#ex:body-one)c) can only be grammatical if *somebody* refers to a person who fell off the table, not to an object that fell. These determinatives are epicene rather than sexual, as they can refer to persons regardless of sex or gender identity.

## 5.3Non-personal determinatives

### 5.3.1 Compound determinatives with -thing and -where

The compound determinatives with *-thing* and *-where* are strictly non-personal in gender:

+--------+-------+---------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| \(30\) | > a\. | > *Something is on the table.*        | \[non-personal\]              |
+========+=======+=======================================+==============================:+
|        | b\.   | > *Everywhere was flooded.*           | \[(non-personal) locations\]  |
+--------+-------+---------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|        | c\.   | > \* *Everything enjoyed themselves.* |                               |
+--------+-------+---------------------------------------+-------------------------------+

Example ([30](#ex:thing-where)c) illustrates that the *-thing* determinatives are strictly non-personal: *everything* can't take the personal reflexive *themselves*, even under a personifying construal. Personification requires selecting a *-body*/*-one* form from the start. These determinatives can't normally designate persons except in special contexts like deliberate depersonalization or euphemism (e.g., *something the stork brought*).

Notably, non-personal designata extend beyond what *thing* covers. While the *-thing* determinatives or the noun *thing* can designate animals, they aren't used to designate non-person humans such as infants except, again, for deliberate depersonalization or euphemism.

### 3.2.2 Temporal determinatives

The compound temporal determinatives *once*, *twice*, and *thrice* (see (Payne et al. 2007)), are also non-personal: [^6]

\(31\) a. *Not three times. Once is enough.* \[temporal, non-personal\]

### 5.3.3 Quantitative determinatives

The determinatives *much*, *little*, and *a little* are consistently non-personal:

> \(32\) a. *Much remains to be done.* \[non-personal\]
>
> b\. *Little was salvaged from the wreck.* \[non-personal\]
>
> c\. \**Much complained about the new policy.* \[personal\]

The ungrammaticality of ([32](#ex:quant-det)c) confirms the non-personal gender of these determinatives, though this likely follows from their selection for non-count nouns -- persons are typically construed as individuated (count) entities. Gender-neutral determinatives like *many* would be possible here.[^7]

## 5.4 Gender-neutral determinatives

Most determinatives in fused-head constructions are gender-neutral -- they can designate both personal and non-personal entities:

+--------+-------+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| \(33\) | > a\. | *Some arrived late.*            | \[can be personal or non-personal\] |
+========+=======+=================================+====================================:+
|        | b\.   | *Many wept.*                    | \[personal context\]                |
+--------+-------+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------+

This gender neutrality in pro-form function applies to most quantifiers (*all*, *both*, *many*, *few*, etc.) when used as fused heads.

Articles (*a*(*n*), *the*) don't occur as fused heads and lie outside the core pro-form system.

## 5.5 The demonstratives

The singular demonstratives *this* and *that* present an interesting challenge to the gender system. Huddleston and Pullum (2002, 422) takes them to be "borderline case" determinatives, suggesting that they straddle the border with pronouns. When they function semantically as pro-forms (in fused-head constructions), their gender status becomes complex:

+--------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| \(34\) | > a\. | > *She works with that.*                                 | \[referring to an object, non-personal\] |
+========+=======+==========================================================+=========================================:+
|        | b\.   | \* *She chatted with that.*                              | \[referring to a person, personal\]      |
+--------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
|        | > c\. | > *This is Yoko*/*an acorn.*                             | \[neutral\]                              |
+--------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
|        | > d\. | > *She chatted with this person and [that]{.underline}.* | \[personal reference with ellipsis\]     |
+--------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+

Example ([34](#ex:demo-head)a) shows that demonstratives in fused-head function can refer to non-personal entities. Example (b) demonstrates that using a demonstrative alone to refer to a person is ungrammatical unless the intention is to insult through depersonalization. Example (c) shows that demonstratives can have personal reference in specificational contexts with *be*. Example (d) illustrates that personal reference is possible with ellipsis where there is a recoverable head noun ('person').

I conclude that the demonstratives are generally gender neutral but that, in fused-head function where a personal interpretation isn't salient in the immediate discourse, the natural interpretation is non-personal, and a personal one is impossible in some situations. This poses a challenge for the present framework and may indicate gradience in the gender system.

## 5.6 Fused heads with special interpretations

Huddleston and Pullum (2002, 414) apply the gender terms personal and non-personal to fused determiner--heads with special interpretations. It lists the "personal" determinatives as *those*, *few*, *many*, *all*, *some*, *each*, and *none*. Under this analysis, there are cases in which a personal interpretation is obligatory or at least highly salient:

+--------+-------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| \(35\) | > a\. | *Those who attended enjoyed themselves.* | \[personal interpretation\] |
+========+=======+==========================================+============================:+
|        | b\.   | *Few would disagree.*                    | \[personal interpretation\] |
+--------+-------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

In these examples, a verb like *attended* or *disagree* applies only to persons. But in other cases such as *few were left*, it's not clear whether this is to be interpreted as 'few people' or 'few things'.

Similarly, Huddleston and Pullum (2002, 414) lists *much*, *little*, *enough*, and *sufficient* as having non-personal special interpretations:

+--------+-------+----------------------------------------+---------------------+
| \(36\) | > a\. | *Much has been written on this topic.* | \[non-personal\]    |
+========+=======+========================================+====================:+
|        | b\.   | *Enough has been said.*                | \[non-personal\]    |
+--------+-------+----------------------------------------+---------------------+

Since these determinatives are consistently non-personal regardless of whether they function as fused determiner--heads or not, I see no need for any special analysis here with respect to gender. These are simply gender-neutral determinatives that, due to their semantic properties, tend to be used in contexts where a personal or non-personal interpretation is salient.

## 5.7 Summary of determinative gender

The participation of determinatives in the English gender system reflects its pro-form-centered architecture:

1.  Most determinatives in fused-head constructions are gender-neutral, including most quantifiers (*all*, *both*, *many*, *few*, *some*, etc.).

2.  The personal pro-form determinatives include the compound determinatives with *-body* and *-one*.

3.  The non-personal pro-form determinatives include the compound determinatives with *-thing* and *-where*, the compound determinatives *once*, *twice*, and *thrice*, and the determinatives *much*, *little*, and *a little*.

4.  The demonstratives *this* and *that* in fused-head function show a non-personal default, though they can have personal reference in specificational contexts or with ellipsis.

5.  Gender percolates beyond strict pro-form function: the personal determinatives *we* and *you* impose personhood constraints even when determining overt heads, reflecting their morphological identity with pronouns (see Section [5](#determinatives-in-the-gender-system)).

6.  Articles (*a(n)*, *the*) don't occur as fused heads and lie outside the core pro-form system.

This distribution demonstrates that the hierarchical gender system is centered on pro-forms but can extend to morphologically and semantically related uses.

# 6 Other pro-forms in the gender system

The analysis to this point has focused on pronouns and determinatives, but the gender system in Modern English extends to all types of pro-forms. This section examines additional pro-forms, including relative pro-forms, prepositions, and other cohesive devices, demonstrating how they participate in the hierarchical gender system based on personhood.

## 6.1 Prepositions

### 6.1.1 Locative

Locative pro-forms such as *where*, *here*, and *there* are consistently non-personal in gender (Huddleston and Pullum 2002, 613). They're locative deictic pro-forms rather than propositional ones, and they designate places or locations, which are conceptualized as non-personal designata:

+--------+-------+-----------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| \(37\) | > a\. | > *The city where I live is beautiful.* | \[non-personal-locative\] |
+========+=======+=========================================+==========================:+
|        | b\.   | > *I stayed there for a week.*          | \[non-personal-locative\] |
+--------+-------+-----------------------------------------+---------------------------+
|        | > c\. | \* *My friend where I stayed\...*       | \[personal\]              |
+--------+-------+-----------------------------------------+---------------------------+

In ([37](#ex:where)a) and (b), the pro-forms *where* and *there* designate non-personal locations. Example (c) is ungrammatical because *where* can't designate a person.

Significantly, the distribution of *where* (and *when*) versus *which* parallels the distribution of *who* versus *which*, as discussed in Section [4.3.1](#alternative-conceptualizations-and-pro-form-selection).[^8]

### 6.1.2 Temporal

Temporal pro-forms such as *when*, *now*, and *then* are also non-personal in gender. They designate times or periods, which are conceptualized as non-persons. The case parallels that of the locative pro-form *where*.

Notably, times and places can be conceptualized in other semantic roles, and this affects the choice of pro-form. I illustrate with a *when* (temporal)/*which* (general) contrast.

+--------+-------+-------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| \(38\) | > a\. | *2010, when*/\**which I left*       | \[as time\]               |
+========+=======+=====================================+==========================:+
|        | b\.   | *2010, which*/\**when has 365 days* | \[as possessor\]          |
+--------+-------+-------------------------------------+---------------------------+

In ([38](#ex:when-which)a), *2010* is conceptualized as a time period, requiring the temporal pro-form *when*. In (b), it's conceptualized as a container, requiring the general pro-form *which*.

## 6.2 Manner pro-forms

Manner pro-forms such as *how* and *thus* deserve special consideration. While they don't designate entities in the straightforward way that other pro-forms do, their behaviour is consistent with the non-personal gender category:

+--------+-------+------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| \(39\) | > a\. | *That's how it's done.*            | \[non-personal\]      |
+========+=======+====================================+======================:+
|        | b\.   | *She spoke thus.*                  | \[non-personal\]      |
+--------+-------+------------------------------------+-----------------------+

These manner pro-forms can only designate ways or methods, which are conceptualized as non-persons. They can't designate persons:

> \(40\) a. \* *Jack is how I learned to swim.* \[without metonymy\]

Example ([40](#ex:how-person)) is ungrammatical unless *Jack* is being conceptualized as a method or manner, not as a person.

## 6.3 Proposition pro-forms

Proposition pro-forms such as *so* and *not* designate propositional content. These pro-forms are generally non-personal:

+--------+-------+-------------------------------------------+------------------+
| \(41\) | > a\. | *She said she was tired, and so she was.* | \[non-personal\] |
+========+=======+===========================================+=================:+
|        | b\.   | *"It's good." "I think so too."*          | \[non-personal\] |
+--------+-------+-------------------------------------------+------------------+

But *so* can arguably designate more than just propositions. In ([42](#ex:so-person)), it appears to designate the type 'boy', suggesting it may be gender neutral. Or, perhaps, these items are different enough that we shouldn't consider them within the current framework.

> \(42\) a. *She said he was a boy, and so he was.* \[personal\]

[]{#ex:so-person .anchor}For present purposes these items are best treated as peripheral non-personal pro-forms, with their occasional person-directed readings arising from independent reanalysis rather than from a dedicated personal value.

## 6.4 Pro-*do*

The pro-verb *do* functions as a pro-form for verbal predicates:

> \(43\) a. *She writes poetry, and he does too.* \[non-personal\]

The predicate 'write poetry' in ([43](#ex:do)) is non-personal-propositional. Again, perhaps these items are different enough that we shouldn't consider them within the current framework.

# 7 Remaining challenges and inconsistencies

The hierarchical gender system proposed in this paper accounts for the vast majority of pro-forms and gender-related phenomena in Modern English. But several challenges and inconsistencies remain. This section addresses these issues transparently, outlining areas where further refinement of the framework may be needed.

## 7.1 The problem of *which* versus *what*

One significant challenge to the current framework is the divergent behaviour of the non-personal pronouns *which* and *what*. Although I have categorized both as non-personal in gender, they show important differences in their patterning with anaphora.

Huddleston and Pullum (2002) notes that *which* can serve as an antecedent to *he* or *she*, as in ([44](#ex:which-he)):

> \(44\) ^?^*That's the dog which~i~ attacked his~i~ owner.* \[*CGEL*: 499, (50iii)\]

[]{#ex:which-he .anchor}This appears to be analogous to the kind of mid-sentence shift in number we find in collectives. But the same shift seems less good with *what*, either as a relative ([45](#ex:what-he)a) or interrogative (b):

> \(45\) a. ^?^*What~i~ attacked his~i~ owner was this dog~i~.*

b\. ^?^*Do you know what~i~ attacked his~i~ owner? This dog~i~.*

[]{#ex:what-he .anchor}Nor, as far as I can tell, can a strictly non-personal determinative like *something* function this way:

> []{#ex:something-he .anchor}(46) \* *It sounds like something~i~ attacked his~i~ owner.*

While further investigation might be needed to confirm the judgment robustly, if we take ([45](#ex:what-he)) and ([46](#ex:something-he)) to be significantly degraded compared to ([44](#ex:which-he)), then there is a need to explain the discrepancy. Why can a speaker shift between *which* and *his* but not between *what* or *something* and *his*? Under this set of facts, *what* and *something* appear to pattern with *it*, and it's *which*, rather than *it*, that seems to require a different treatment.

One possible explanation is gradience in the non-personal gender. We see gradience in many other linguistic categories. Huddleston and Pullum (2002, 54), for instance, describes "prototypical NPs" as "the most central type, those that are most clearly and distinctively NPs". It might be the case, then, that some words like *something* are prototypically non-personal and those like *which* are more marginal. For instance, *something* seems possible with animals but not with infants or collective nouns. This is, however, speculative, and more research would be needed to substantiate such an explanation.

A straightforward way to probe this is to compare acceptability of mixed chains across *which*/*what*/*something* with matched contexts and minimal prosodic focus variation, predicting the gradient you informally report.

## 7.2 The case of collective nouns

Collective nouns such as *team*, *committee*, or *government* present another challenge to the gender system, as they do to the number system. These may be referred to using either personal or non-personal pronouns:

+--------+-------+------------------------------------------+----------------------------+
| \(47\) | > a\. | *The team has scored its first goal.*    | \[singular, non-personal\] |
+========+=======+==========================================+===========================:+
|        | b\.   | *The team have scored their first goal.* | \[plural, personal\]       |
+--------+-------+------------------------------------------+----------------------------+

In ([47](#ex:collective)a), the collective noun *team* is treated as a singular non-personal entity, taking the singular non-personal possessive pronoun *its*. In (b), it's treated as a plurality of persons, taking the plural personal possessive pronoun *their*.

A number-only analysis captures part of this pattern, but it doesn't explain why the pro-form choice tracks personhood as well as plurality. The alternation is about how the collective is construed, not just about morphosyntactic number.

This variation might be explained by the flexible nature of our conceptualization of collectives. We can consider a team to comprise a number of persons or to be a single non-person. It's even possible to shift perspective mid-sentence as in ([48](#ex:collective-shift)):

> []{#ex:collective-shift .anchor}(48) *The team has scored their first goal.* \[shift from singular to plural\] Here, there is a shift from singular verb agreement (*has*) to plural pronoun agreement (*their*). What isn't possible, though, is to consider the team to be an individual person:

Here, there is a shift from singular verb agreement (*has*) to plural pronoun agreement (*their*). What isn't possible, though, is to consider the team to be an individual person:

> \(49\) \**The team~i~ has scored on themself~i~.*

The ungrammaticality of ([49](#ex:collective-person)) suggests that collectives can be conceptualized as either singular non-persons or plural persons, but not as singular persons.

On this account, any robust and naturalistic examples of singular personal anaphora with a collective construed as a single individual would count against the analysis and are therefore an empirical target for future work.

A further complication arises with relative pronouns and collectives. Huddleston and Pullum (2002, 498) note that collectives may be referred to using either the relative pronouns *which* or *who*, but no such alternation is possible between non-personal *it* and *he* or *she* when the collective has a singular interpretation. But the behaviour of *what* with collectives hasn't been extensively investigated.

Consider a discussion concerning two teams, wherein somebody asks:

> \(50\) a. *Who will need their missing player more?* \[personal\]
>
> b\. \**What will need their missing player more?* \[non-personal\]

Example ([50](#ex:team-who-what)b) seems impossible for *what* designating a team, suggesting that *what* can't serve as an antecedent for *their* in this context. This points to a more complex interaction between the choice of relative or interrogative pronoun and the subsequent choice of anaphoric pronoun than a simple personal/non-personal distinction would predict.

## 7.3 The demonstratives in fused-head function

As for *this*/*that* in fused-head function, Section [5](#determinatives-in-the-gender-system) shows they are generally gender-neutral with a non-personal default unless a salient personal head or ellipsis licenses a personal reading. I treat their behaviour as a locus-sensitive effect rather than a distinct gender value.

## 7.4 Proposition, predicate, and manner pro-forms

Pro-forms that substitute for propositions, predicates, and manners -- such as *so*, *thus*, and pro-verb *do* -- present a challenge to the gender system proposed here, as discussed in Sections [6.2](#manner-pro-forms)--[6.4](#pro-do). Since these items primarily substitute for verbal predicates or clauses rather than entities, they appear at first glance to fall outside a gender system organized around personhood.

But the boundary between entity-referring and non-entity-referring pro-forms isn't always clear-cut. Consider how pronouns like *it*, *something*, and relative *which* can refer to propositional content in ([51](#ex:propositions)).

> []{#ex:propositions .anchor}(51) a. *It surprised me that she arrived early.*

b\. *I didn't understand it.*

+-------+-----------------------------------------+-----------------+
| > c\. | *Something wasn't understood.*          | \[proposition\] |
+=======+=========================================+================:+
| d\.   | *It wasn't clear, which surprised me.*  | \[proposition\] |

In these cases, *it*, *which*, and *something* pattern grammatically as non-personal pronouns. This suggests that propositions and clauses, though abstract, are consistently conceptualized as entities within the non-personal category.

The case of *so* is particularly instructive. While it typically references propositional content as in ([41](#ex:so)), it can also designate persons as in ([42](#ex:so-person)).

This flexibility suggests two possibilities: either (1) *so* is genuinely gender-neutral, or (2) there are two homonymous forms of *so* with different grammatical properties. Neither solution is entirely satisfactory.

One theoretical possibility would be to extend the non-personal gender to include all pro-forms specialized for propositions, predicates, and manners. This approach finds some support in the fact that propositions already participate in grammatical number and person agreement -- systems typically associated with nominal entities. The third-person singular agreement in *That it fails is obvious* demonstrates this nominal-like behaviour.

Still, including these pro-forms would significantly expand the scope of the gender system. For the purposes of this analysis, I tentatively classify these items as peripheral members of the non-personal gender category, while acknowledging that this analysis requires further investigation.

# 8 Conclusion

This paper has demonstrated a reconceptualization of the English gender system as a hierarchical structure based on attributed personhood rather than biological sex. The system is pro-form-centered but not pro-form-exclusive: through systematic analysis of pronouns, determinatives (especially in pro-form function), relatives, interrogatives, and other cohesive devices, I have demonstrated that the primary value distinction in Modern English operates between personal and non-personal, with sexual gender (masculine/feminine) functioning as a subcategory within the personal gender domain. Gender percolates beyond strict pro-form function to morphologically related items and semantically neighboring uses, reflecting the historical evolution from noun-class to designatum-based gender. Unlike grammatical gender systems where the antecedent formally controls gender assignment, in English it's the designatum -- how an entity is conceptualized -- that determines gender selection.

## 8.1 Summary of key claims

\(1\) English gender is a lexical, designatum-driven system on pro-forms whose primary value split is [personal]{.smallcaps} vs. [non-personal]{.smallcaps}. (2) [Masculine]{.smallcaps}/[feminine]{.smallcaps} are subtypes within [personal]{.smallcaps}; [locative]{.smallcaps}/[temporal]{.smallcaps} are systematic subtypes within [non-personal]{.smallcaps}. (3) Chain-internal coherence, possessor-aligned genitives, and the *who*/*which*--*where*/*when* partitions all fall out from (1)--(2).

## 8.2 Theoretical implications

This revised understanding of the English gender system has several theoretical implications:

First, it challenges the traditional characterization of English gender (as a three-way, pronoun-only distinction) by demonstrating that English possesses a robust grammatical gender system with clear semantic foundations (centered on personhood), operating systematically across the full range of pro-forms.

Second, it provides a more principled explanation for the distribution of gendered forms by tying them to grammaticalized conceptual categories related to personhood, thereby bridging linguistic description with philosophical and psychological accounts of this core concept.

Third, it reframes the typological position of English, suggesting it has not a "weakened" gender system but rather a distinct type built on a designatum-based mechanism where speaker conceptualization takes precedence over formal grammatical properties. This raises the question of whether other languages exhibit similar pro-form-based gender systems -- a possibility that typologists and field linguists should consider when documenting gender in understudied languages, or even in well-studied languages like English.

Finally, the proposal is easy to translate into familiar terms without committing to any one of them: in index/concord terms, English realizes index-level classification on pro-forms; in approaches that locate gender on N in languages with concord, English can be seen as relocating the relevant information to the pro-form lexicon; in presuppositional approaches to *he*/*she*/*they*, the analysis makes explicit the inventory of classifications ([personal]{.smallcaps}, [non-personal]{.smallcaps}, and their subtypes) that those pronouns presuppose (Wechsler and Zlatić 2011; Kramer 2015; Bjorkman 2017; Konnelly and Cowper 2020).

## 8.3 Remaining questions and future research

Despite the explanatory power of this framework, several questions remain for future research:

First, the relationship between certain pro-forms and the gender system needs further investigation. As shown in Section [7](#remaining-challenges-and-inconsistencies), demonstratives in fused-head function and the divergent behaviour of non-personal pro-forms like *which* and *what* exhibit complex patterns not fully captured by the current framework.

Second, the possibility of gradience within gender categories merits systematic study, perhaps using corpus data to establish patterns of usage and to identify prototypical versus peripheral members of each category.

Third, dialectal variation deserves explicit modelling. The hierarchy is stable in principle, variable in practice, and reweighted in dialect. In some dialects, the same exponent position is filled by a mass--count distinction rather than a personhood distinction, suggesting that the hierarchy's structure may be more stable cross-dialectally than its semantic basis. Work on Southwest English and contact varieties such as Newfoundland shows pronominal systems that organize around mass--count rather than personhood (Siemund 2013). A robust account should allow a dialect parameter or a semantic sub-branch under non-personal to capture these systems without treating them as noise.

Fourth, pragmatic overlays such as affect, personification, and identity marking can reclassify a designatum on the fly. These look less like changes to the hierarchy and more like discourse-level reassignments, but they shape real usage and need systematic description.

Fifth, the interaction between gender and number in collective nouns represents an area where the current framework could be refined. The ability of collectives to take either singular non-personal or plural personal agreement points to a flexibility in conceptualization that deserves more detailed analysis.

Sixth, the status of proposition, predicate, and manner pro-forms within or outside the gender system requires further examination. Whether these should be classified as non-personal or as falling outside the gender system altogether remains an open question.

Seventh, diachronic research could illuminate how the Modern English pro-form-gender system evolved from the more traditional three-gender system of Old English (Kastovsky 2000; Siemund and Dolberg 2011; Dolberg 2019). One intriguing hypothesis is that as English lost its grammatical gender system during the Middle English period, the personhood-based distinctions that may have existed alongside it became more prominent and expanded their functional domain. Under this view, the remnants of grammatical gender were subsumed within a pre-existing designatum-based gender system, with masculine and feminine becoming subcategories of personal gender while neuter was reinterpreted as non-personal. This hypothesis would need to be verified through historical corpus analysis, examining how pro-form usage evolved as grammatical gender was being lost.

## 8.4 Concluding thoughts

The English pro-form-gender system is more complex and more principled than traditional accounts suggest. By recognizing its hierarchical nature, its grounding in concepts of personhood, and its designatum-based operation, we gain a more accurate and more explanatory account of how gender functions in Modern English.

The personal--non-personal distinction that forms the backbone of this system reflects our conceptual categorization of the world into persons and non-persons -- a categorization that is flexible, context-dependent, and deeply embedded in our cognitive and linguistic systems. Unlike grammatical gender systems where the antecedent formally controls gender assignment regardless of conceptualization, the English system allows speakers to assign gender based on how they conceptualize entities in discourse.

This approach not only offers a more accurate description of the data but also reveals systematic patterns previously obscured by accounts that treat gender as merely a three-way distinction limited to pronouns. The grammatical violations that result when speakers produce sentences like \**The person which I met* confirm the grammatical nature of this system across the full range of pro-forms and its significance for our understanding of English grammar, gender-inclusive language, and the relationship between grammar and conceptual categorization.

English gender isn't a vestige; it's a system. It isn't scattered exceptions; it's a hierarchy. It isn't semantics without grammar; it's grammar with semantic foundations.

[^2]: I use [pro-form]{.smallcaps} as a semantic cover term for items whose interpretation is anaphoric or deictic (pronouns, most instances of relative words, and a subset of determinatives). It isn't a syntactic category. [Pronoun]{.smallcaps} is a lexical/syntactic category. The generalisations stated here attach to the lexical entries of those items; nothing hinges on treating pro-form as a morphosyntactic natural class.

[^3]: Interestingly, even in these grammatical-gender languages, certain pro-forms that lack antecedents -- particularly interrogatives like Spanish *quién*/*qué*, French *qui*/*quoi*, and German *wer*/*was* -- display a personhood-based distinction similar to English. This suggests that the personal/non-personal distinction may be a more universal semantic feature that operates alongside formal gender systems, though in these languages it remains constrained to specific contexts rather than overriding grammatical gender in anaphoric reference.

[^4]: This aligns with the idea that English pro-forms realize index-level content rather than NP-internal concord; see (Wechsler and Zlatić 2011) for the index/concord distinction.

[^5]: In fused relatives like *What you see is what you get.*

[^6]: A related phenomenon appears with *last* and *next* (e.g., *last week*, *next Tuesday*), which Huddleston and Pullum (2002) classify as determinatives. These items select for temporal nouns, suggesting that temporal gender-like features may extend beyond pro-forms to the determination relation itself. Whether this constitutes a form of agreement or merely lexical selection is beyond the scope of this paper.

[^7]: This connects to dialectal systems where mass--count serves as the primary gender distinction rather than personhood (Siemund 2013); see Section [8](#conclusion) for discussion.

[^8]: Reference grammars commonly note the personal--non-personal split between *who* and *which*, but fail to extend the same logic to the temporal--non-temporal and locative--non-locative splits between *when*/*where* and *which*, even though the type of distinction is identical.
