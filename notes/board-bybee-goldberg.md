From a construction-grammar perspective, Bybee \& Moder (1983) belongs first in **Chapter 4**, not because it is “about mechanisms,” but because it is one of the clearest demonstrations that a *grammatical* category can have prototype structure, family resemblance, and graded membership while remaining psychologically real. If Chapter 4 is where you persuade readers that HPC kinds are not metaphysical hand-waving, the *string/strung* class is an existence proof: speakers’ past-tense choices track similarity to an output-oriented schema, not a definition or a rule-plus-list.

That said, the paper also merits a deliberate callback in **Chapter 7**, because it effectively operationalizes an attractor landscape. The probability of the irregular past decreases as phonological distance from the prototype increases, and the historical expansion of the class follows those similarity gradients. Those are exactly the facts you want on the table when you introduce “dynamical basins” and stabilisers: a constructional family whose coherence is maintained by ongoing, similarity-based generalization, even as membership changes.

On (2), I would resist the simple equation “analogical attraction = homeostatic mechanism.” In HPC terms, *homeostasis* names the explanatory job—what keeps the cluster clustered across speakers and time—whereas analogical attraction names one plausible cognitive process that can contribute to that job. In the Bybee \& Moder case, the attraction is plausibly amplified by cue validity and entrenchment of high-frequency exemplars; together these yield a self-reinforcing basin that both stabilizes the pattern and enables “maintenance through renovation.”

Concretely: in Chapter 4, cite Bybee \& Moder (1983) right at your pivot from prototype theory to the maintenance view (where you say prototype theory described the shape but didn’t explain why it holds together), or in the “diachrony becomes visible” payoff as your compact example of similarity-driven recruitment (e.g., *dig/dug* moving toward the strong-verb family). In Chapter 7, add a short callback in §7.1 “Stabilisers at multiple scales,” either adjacent to the “dynamical basins” row in Table~7.1 or in your later paragraph addressed to prototype theorists, using the *string/strung* gradient data as the cleanest linguistic illustration of an attractor maintained by analogy.
