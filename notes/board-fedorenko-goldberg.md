Fedorenko’s “language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought” claim sits quite naturally with construction grammar, provided we keep “communication” broad enough to include discourse management, stance, and interactional coordination (not merely reference transfer). Constructions are *conventional* form–meaning pairings, and their meanings are inherently action-oriented: they encode what a speaker is doing with an utterance in context. On this view, grammar is not an autonomous calculus that happens to be used for communication; it is a repertoire of learned pairings whose raison d’être is to make communicative intentions publicly recoverable.

At the same time, construction grammar doesn’t need to deny that language can support cognition. Constructions package experience and invite particular construals (causation, transfer, evidential stance), and speakers can of course use these resources “offline” for planning or rehearsal. But the explanatory center of gravity remains usage in interaction: the meanings we posit are the meanings that make sense of distributional facts and alternations in communicative practice. So Fedorenko’s emphasis on communication aligns with a usage-based construal of “meaning,” while her dissociation claims are best read as a warning against collapsing linguistic competence into general reasoning.

For the HPC story, this framing is helpful rather than threatening. If linguistic categories are homeostatically maintained clusters, communicative coordination is one of the most plausible stabilisers: social uptake, conventionalization, competition/preemption among near-alternatives, and the relentless pressure to be understood quickly and reliably. Fedorenko’s thesis pushes the book to treat *functional feedback* (communicative success/failure) as a central maintenance mechanism alongside learning biases and processing constraints. The only complication is salutary: if communication is the forcing function, then “kinds” in grammar may be stabilized as much by interactional ecology and cultural transmission as by purely internal cognitive architecture—exactly the sort of multi-scale homeostasis your framework wants.

In the HPC book, I would cite the communication paper where you cash out the maintenance mechanisms: **Chapter 7** under functional feedback / communicative pressure (\autocite{Fedorenko2024}), and again in **Chapter 14** when you step back to the “what language is for” big picture and defuse language-of-thought objections. If you also want a neural-level analogue for “natural kind” talk, Fedorenko’s companion paper on the language network as a natural kind can sit in **Chapter 4** (HPC kinds without essences) and/or **Chapter 7** (neural stabilisers) as an existence proof that the relevant clustering can be discovered by function, not stipulated by anatomy (\autocite{Fedorenko2024naturalkind}).
