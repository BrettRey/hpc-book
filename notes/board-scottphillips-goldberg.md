It is validating to see Scott-Phillips invoking "constructions all the way down" alongside the "Principle of No Synonymy." This is precisely the groundwork we’ve laid: language isn’t a set of arbitrary algebraic rules, but a network of form-function pairings shaped by usage. By tying linguistic intuitions to the **presumption of optimal relevance**, he is essentially operationalizing the "Functional feedback" mechanism you identify in **Chapter 7**. He provides the causal machinery for *why* the cluster stabilizes: forms that fail to maximize relevance (by being too costly to process or offering no communicative gain over an existing alternative) are pruned from the system.

I would strongly recommend placing the primary citation in **Chapter 7**, specifically in Section 7.2 under "Stabilisers at multiple scales." His argument fits perfectly into the "Dynamical basins" or "Reciprocal feedback" rows of your table. He is describing the *forcing function*—communicative pressure—that drives the system into stable attractor states. If "grammaticality" is just the state of having high communicative relevance and low processing cost, then he has identified the very engine of homeostasis.

However, the "byproduct" aspect of his thesis is a crucial diagnostic tool for **Chapter 8 (Failure modes)**. If intuitions are merely byproducts of relevance processing and not direct reads of a "grammar module," this supports your argument against the "Inflation problem." It helps distinguish between a genuine structural failure (a broken kind) and a mere processing failure (a sentence that is technically generative but pragmatically weird). You can use his work here to warn against reifying every awkward sentence judgment into a deep theoretical distinction.

Ultimately, this work bridges the gap between the cognitive/social functionalist view I champion and the mechanism-first ontology you are building. By positing that there is "No Synonymy"—a version of the Principle of No Synonymy I’ve discussed regarding *avoided synonymy* and preemption—he confirms that the "cluster" is maintained by competition. We don't say *gived* not because of a blocked rule, but because *gave* already occupies that functional niche more effectively. Cite him in Chapter 7 to explain the mechanism, and in Chapter 8 to explain the data.
