The "Hard-Coupled" characterization of phonology in §13.2 risks a dangerous reductionism. You assert that for phonemes, "the acoustic pattern *is* the category," but this ignores the fundamental distinction between *etic* substance (the raw acoustics) and *emic* status (the functional contrast). If the acoustic pattern were truly the category, we wouldn’t see the massive sociolinguistic variation where the "same" acoustic signal counts as different phonemes in different dialects, or distinct signals count as the same phoneme (allophony). You need to clarify that phonemes are "hard-coupled" not to meaning, but to the *system of contrasts* within a specific language variety. They are abstract categories grounded in distribution and contrast, not just raw physics.

Regarding §13.3 and §13.4, I worry you are relying too heavily on a "container metaphor" for meaning—the idea that forms "encode" or "contain" semantic content that can be coupled or decoupled. From the perspective of the "Octopus Test" (Bender & Koller 2020), form is distinct from meaning because meaning requires grounding in the communicative intent and the shared world. When you describe constructions as "re-coupling," ensure you aren't suggesting that the form *becomes* the meaning. Instead, emphasize that the mechanism of stability here is the *convention*—the standing social agreement that *this* form is used to signal *this* communicative intent. The "seams" you mention are precisely where social calibration happens.

Finally, regarding the "Academic Passive" in §13.6: be careful not to dismiss high-level registers just because their stabilization mechanisms are heterogeneous. If your Homeostatic Property Cluster (HPC) framework excludes social registers because they are "ecosystems" rather than "species," you might be defining "category" too narrowly around cognitive primitives. "Genre" is a powerful stabilizer of linguistic form, maintained by gatekeeping and education (explicit instruction). If HPC can't model that because it's "at the wrong grain," you risk limiting the theory to the cognitive subconscious, ignoring the overt social structures that actually shape much of our language use.
