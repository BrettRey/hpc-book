# Board feedback (Adele Goldberg voice) — Sullivan (2016) placement

Sullivan (2016) is most valuable in this book as a *disciplinary warning* about reifying labels into kinds. That makes her a natural fit for **Chapter 8 (Failure modes)**, not for the forward-driving opening of **Chapter 4 (Kinds without essences)**.

## Recommendation (where and why)

- **Primary home: Chapter 8.** Ch 8 opens by naming the *inflation problem* (“you start seeing it everywhere”). Sullivan gives you a concrete, adjacent-field instance of inflation: investigators can share a construct name while failing to coordinate the target phenomenon and its operationalization, yielding reliability without validity. Used here, Sullivan *reinforces* your guardrail rather than *undercutting* your foundation.
- **Only a minimal preview in Chapter 4, if you want one.** If you cite her in Ch 4 at all, keep it to a footnote-sized “this is a known risk; we’ll discipline it in Ch 8” move—otherwise she slows the reader’s uptake of the maintenance view right when you need momentum.

## (1) Does MPC add value beyond Boyd (for *this* book)?

Probably not in Chapter 4’s main text. You already do the work MPC is meant to do when you (i) foreground *mechanisms* (§4.2 “What mechanisms mean”) and (ii) cite Craver on mechanisms carving joints. Adding “MPC” risks a second acronym and a detour into philosophy-of-neuroscience vocabulary without buying additional clarity for linguists.

If you like the *mechanistic gloss*, keep it in prose (no new term): “clusters whose co-instantiation is explained and stabilized by mechanisms.” If you *do* name MPC, treat it as a parenthetical synonym for readers who know the mechanistic literature, not as an additional framework you expect the reader to track.

## (2) The counter-argument you should make (construct drift vs. constructional grounding)

Sullivan’s critique targets *psychological constructs* that are (a) often operationalized via lab tasks and (b) vulnerable to drift across labs and review practices. A construction-grammar-friendly response is to concede the general risk—*labels can circulate and stabilize socially without tracking a single mechanism*—while stressing that grammatical categories (especially when analyzed as **generalizations over constructions**) are typically anchored in:

- **Publicly available usage distributions** (corpora, attested alternations, cross-linguistic comparanda), not solely in task-induced proxies.
- **Communicative coordination pressures**: speakers must align in real time for interaction to succeed, which functions as an everyday “construct explication process” that checks runaway drift.
- **A natural grain of analysis**: if you treat *constructions* (form–meaning pairings) and their families as the primary objects, you reduce the risk that a single label (e.g., “adverb,” “subject”) pools heterogeneous mechanisms.

This lets you use Sullivan as a foil without conceding that “all special-science kinds are hopeless”: the right lesson is methodological—treat category labels as hypotheses that must earn projectibility and stability—rather than global anti-realism.

## (3) Specific placement (sentence-level)

### Best placement: Chapter 8, right after you define the inflation problem

In `chapters/chapter08.tex`, after the paragraph that introduces the inflation problem (ending “pattern we have a name for.”), add **one sentence** (main text or a footnote) that links inflation to construct validity in an adjacent science.

Example main-text sentence:
> A practice-based version of this worry shows up in cognitive neuroscience: researchers can converge on a construct label while operationalizing it in divergent ways, undermining “construct validity” and the prospects for discovering mechanism-grounded clusters \autocite{Sullivan2016}.

Then, if you want the construction-grammar contrast, follow immediately with a short bridge (1–2 sentences) that says why linguistic categories are *better positioned* (usage + coordination), while still needing diagnostics (thin/fat/negative).

### Good alternative: Chapter 8 §8.1, where you widen to “cognition generally”

Right after: “Why does linguistics—and cognition generally—generate labels that feel like kinds but turn out to be something else?”, insert a tight footnote pointing to Sullivan as the “cognition generally” case.

### Optional preview (only if you feel the need): Chapter 4, as a subordinated footnote

If you want to signal early that HPC talk can be abused outside linguistics, attach a footnote to the first mention of HPC kinds in `chapters/chapter04.tex` (the Boyd paragraph). Keep it explicitly forward-referential to Ch 8:

> In cognitive neuroscience, related proposals recast HPC-style kinds in mechanistic terms (“mechanistic property clusters”); Sullivan argues that ordinary research practice can be too weakly coordinated for such clusters to be identified reliably, a caution that motivates the failure-mode diagnostics in Chapter 8 \autocite{Sullivan2016}.

Net effect: Chapter 4 stays an invitation; Chapter 8 is where Sullivan does her real work.
