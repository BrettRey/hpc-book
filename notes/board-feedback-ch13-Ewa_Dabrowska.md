Here is some feedback on your Chapter 13 plan, focusing on the tension between your idealized "Stack" and the reality of individual variation.

First, I worry that your "Stack" model (§13.5) implicitly resurrects the "uniformity assumption"—the idea that all native speakers share the same underlying architectural competence. When you describe the "coupling regime" of constructions as "re-coupled" with "visible seams," you must ask: **visible to whom?** My research demonstrates that many speakers rely heavily on unanalyzed, holistic chunks (prefabs) for what linguists analyze as compositional syntax. For a highly literate speaker, a complex construction might indeed be a re-coupled system of slots and fillers; for a speaker with lower educational attainment, that same string might be as "hard-coupled" and unanalyzed as a phoneme. You need to account for the fact that the *nature* of the coupling often depends on the individual's level of attainment, not just the linguistic level itself.

Second, your treatment of Morphology (§13.3) as the "onset of decoupling" is neat but potentially misleading if you ignore frequency effects. High-frequency multimorphemic forms are often stored whole. The "decoupling" you describe—where form and meaning are separable—is a capacity of the system, but in actual processing, users often bypass this decomposition. If you frame this purely as a property of the *system* (the abstract HPC) rather than the *users* (the cognitive representation), you risk drifting back into Structuralism. You should qualify that while the *potential* for decoupling exists at the morpheme level, the *mechanism* of maintenance relies on a mix of decomposition (rules) and storage (exemplars), the balance of which varies wildly between individuals.

Finally, regarding §13.6 and the "Academic passive," I strongly advise against labeling this a "Negative Case" or a failure of homeostasis. It is actually a **perfect** example of a socially restricted HPC. It *is* stable, but its stability is maintained by a very specific set of mechanisms: explicit instruction, editorial gatekeeping, and the feedback loops of literacy. By dismissing it as "wrong grain," you miss a rhetorical opportunity to show that HPCs can be niche-dependent. The "Academic passive" is a robust category for me and my colleagues; it just doesn't exist for the general population. This supports your framework: it shows that without the specific stabilizing mechanisms (schooling), the category fails to materialize in the individual mind.
