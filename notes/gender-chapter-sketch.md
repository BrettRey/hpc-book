# Chapter Sketch: Grammatical Gender and the Maintenance Spectrum

**Status**: SKETCH — for discussion
**Potential Position**: Ch 11.5 (after Lexical Categories, before The Stack) or Ch 15 (new)

---

## Core Argument

Grammatical gender systems illustrate the full spectrum of HPC maintenance mechanisms:

| System | Mechanism Profile | Form-Meaning Link |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **English** | Semantic congruence (designatum-driven) | Live |
| **German** | Mixed (some semantic, mostly entrenched) | Fraying |
| **French** | Pure entrenchment (antecedent-driven) | Dead |

This is the **maintenance spectrum**: from semantically transparent HPCs to purely conventional ones.

## Proposed Structure (~3500 words)

### §1 — Hook: The Same Word, Different Rules (~300 words)
- English *she* requires a personal-feminine designatum
- French *elle* requires a feminine antecedent (regardless of referent)
- The "French fries" metonymy example: English tracks the waiter; French tracks the noun
- Promise: what maintains gender systems differs by language

### §2 — The English System: Designatum-Driven Gender (~700 words)
- **Hierarchical structure**: Personal > (Epicene | Sexual) > (Masculine | Feminine)
- **Non-personal splits**: General | Locative | Temporal
- The *who/which* distinction as grammaticalized personhood
- Gender follows construal, not antecedent form (*the country... she*)
- **Mechanism**: semantic congruence between pro-form and source

### §3 — The French System: Entrenchment-Driven Gender (~600 words)
- Noun-class gender: arbitrary assignment, NP-internal concord
- Pronouns track antecedent form, not referent
- Metonymy failure: *les patates frites* → *elles*, even if the waiter is male
- **Mechanism**: morphological entrenchment, no live semantic link

### §4 — German as the Hybrid Case (~500 words)
- Noun-class gender on nouns (like French)
- But pronouns can track referent under certain conditions
- *Das Mädchen... sie* (grammatical neuter, pronominal feminine)
- Where does the semantic override come from?

### §5 — The Maintenance Spectrum (~600 words)
- **Semantic transparency** (English): form-meaning pairing is live; the cluster is thin but principled
- **Pure entrenchment** (French): form-meaning link is dead; the cluster is thick but arbitrary
- **Hybrid** (German): two mechanisms in tension
- HPC predicts: transparent systems are easier to learn; entrenched systems are more stable over time
- Acquisition evidence: English gender errors vs. French gender errors

### §6 — Implications for the Taxonomy (~400 words)
- English gender is a **thin semantic HPC** (like adjectives)
- French gender is a **thick entrenched HPC** (like inflectional class)
- The "same" category (grammatical gender) has different ontological status depending on maintenance
- **Field-relative projectibility**: typologists may lump English and French gender; acquisition researchers shouldn't

### §7 — Summary (~300 words)
- Gender systems are not one kind of thing
- The maintenance spectrum predicts different learning curves, different diachronic trajectories
- What looks like the same category may be held together by different forces

## Fit with Book Architecture

**Option A**: Insert as Chapter 11.5 (new chapter between Ch 11 and Ch 12)
- Pro: Extends lexical category discussion naturally
- Con: Part III becomes 5 chapters (9, 10, 11, 11.5, 12)

**Option B**: Replace Ch 12 ("The Stack") or fold into it
- Pro: Stack chapter is currently less developed
- Con: Loses the phoneme-to-construction coupling argument

**Option C**: Add as Chapter 15 in Part IV
- Pro: Implications section; gender as worked example of the whole framework
- Con: Part IV is already 2 chapters (13, 14); adding a third may unbalance

**Recommendation**: Option A — gender as Ch 11.5 (renumber to Ch 12, push Stack to Ch 13)

## Decision Points

1. Full chapter or extended section in Ch 11?
2. If full chapter, where in the book?
3. How much of your paper to incorporate directly?
