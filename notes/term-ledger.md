# Term Ledger

**Purpose**: Prevent terminology drift across chapters. Populate during drafting.

## Core Terms

| Term | Definition | Intro | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|-------|
| _HPC kind_ | Category with non-accidental property cluster, maintained by stabilizers, supporting scoped induction | Ch 4 | ≠ natural kind; always state scope |
| _mechanism_ | Causal process maintaining clustering | Ch 4 | Use in philosophy-of-science contexts |
| _stabilizer_ | Functional role a mechanism plays (preferred term in case studies) | Ch 7 | Default in Chs 9–13 |
| _homeostasis_ | Dynamic stability via feedback; clustering persists/repairs under perturbation | Ch 4 | ≠ static equilibrium |
| _projectibility_ | Degree to which a category supports scoped induction | Ch 6 | Gradient; task-relative |
| _profile_ | Observable property configuration under a given operationalisation | Ch 4 | What we measure vs what we claim |

## Failure Modes

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| _thin class_ | Weak clustering / no stabilizer story |
| _fat class_ | Heterogeneous subclusters under one label |
| _negative class_ | Defined by absence or contrast-set complement |
| _convenience class_ | Umbrella for thin/fat/negative |

## Opponent Terms

| Term | Definition | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| _essentialism_ | Categories constituted by necessary/sufficient conditions | Not straw-man; see Ch 2 §2.1 |
| _nominalism_ | Categories as analyst constructs with no external constraints | ≠ Haspelmath's comparative concepts |
| _comparative concept_ | Cross-linguistic yardstick (Haspelmath) | Ch 3; may be diagnosed as HPC or convenience class |

## Watch List

| Term | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| _natural kind_ | Conflation with HPC kind | Ch 4 NK ≠ HPC section |
| _mechanism_ | Vagueness / inflation | Prefer _stabilizer_; specify process type |
| _cluster_ | Rhetorical placeholder | Use _profile_ for measurement-level talk |

## Drafting Discipline

- New term in a second chapter → add ledger entry first
- New sense → split entry or rewrite to avoid
- Part III chapters: scope + stabilizers + projectibility + falsifier
