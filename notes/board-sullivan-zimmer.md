This sounds like a classic tension between "establishing the theory" and "stress-testing the theory." If I were writing this for a broad audience, I’d urge you to save Sullivan for **Chapter 8 (Failure Modes)**. Here is why.

Chapter 4 is your "romance" chapter. You are seducing the reader with the elegance of the maintenance view—the spinning top, the biological parallel, the sheer logic of it. You need that chapter to be clean, propulsive, and affirmative. If you introduce Sullivan’s skepticism there, you risk muddying the water just as you’re trying to get the reader to see the reflection. You don't want them worrying about whether neuroscience fails to find these kinds before they’ve even understood what the kinds *are* in your context. Keep Chapter 4 focused on the "spinning top" metaphor; don't clutter the floor with broken toys yet.

Chapter 8, however, is where the rubber meets the road. This is where you admit that science is messy and that we often fool ourselves. Sullivan’s argument—that we might have reliability (everyone uses the word "spatial memory") without validity (nobody is studying the same mechanism)—is the perfect, high-stakes illustration of your "Inflation Problem." It shows the reader that this isn't just a linguistic quibble; it's a deep epistemological trap that even the "hard" sciences fall into.

By placing her in Chapter 8, you turn a dry academic citation into a powerful warning shot. You can say, "Look, even neuroscientists struggle with this. They have the scanners, but they don't always have the kinds." This validates your "Fat Cluster" diagnostic beautifully: a category can be institutionally massive (journals, grants, departments) but mechanically hollow. That’s a story readers will remember.
