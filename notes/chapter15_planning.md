# Chapter 15: The Social Stabilization of Kinds (Planning)

**Status:** Planning
**Goal:** Argue that sociolinguistic structure (varieties, registers) is not "noise" but the *mechanism* that maintains kinds. A category is a cluster *within* a population/register.

## Core Argument
1.  **The Stabilizer is the Population:** Kinds don't float in the ether. They are maintained by communities.
2.  **The "Latent Mixture" Model:** What looks like "free variation" or "inconsistency" is often a mixture of two distinct, highly stable systems (e.g., Standard vs. AAVE copula).
3.  **Varieties as Conditioning:** A "Variety" isn't a separate grammar; it's a conditioning environment ($V$) that shifts the probability of Form ($F$) given Category ($C$). $P(F \mid C, V)$.

## Structure

### 15.1 The Problem of Variation
- Start with the "Noise" view: Variation looks like the cluster falling apart.
- If $P(F \mid C)$ isn't 1.0, is the category broken?
- The Solution: It's not broken; it's *conditioned*.

### 15.2 The Community as the Mechanism
- Entrenchment is "community entrenchment" ($C^t(u)$).
- Who is the community?
- **Case Study: The "Lift" example.** ("Do you lift?" is grammatical for gym-goers, ungrammatical for movers).
- Theoretical point: The "Grammar" is parameterised by the social context.

### 15.3 Varieties as Latent Mixtures
- The challenge: "Variable Rules" (Labov).
- Our re-framing: The mixture model.
- If you pool two stable registers, you get a "fat" mess.
- **Diagnostics:**
    - If you condition on the variety (social tag, register tag), does the projectibility return?
    - If yes, the variety is a *stabilizer* for the kind.

### 15.4 Register: The Internal Community
- "Academic Register" isn't a dialect; it's a *stance*.
- Use the "Academic Register" notes (previously targeted for Ch 13).
- **Key metaphor:** The "Shopping" vs "Lifting" modes. You don't lose your "standard" grammar when you switch; you change the conditioning parameter.

### 15.5 Implications for the "Nominalist Challenge"
- This sets up the final chapter.
- If kinds are relative to populations, are they "real"?
- Yes—just as species are real relative to ecosystems.

## Worked Examples to Migrate
- **Academic Register** (from Ch 13 plan)
- **Code-switching** (The "Vamos a hacer shopping" example from Ch 14 draft)
- **Singular 'They'** (Resistance/Innovation spread)

## Integration
- **Previous Ch 13:** Focused on "The Stack" (internal levels).
- **New Ch 15:** Focuses on "The Width" (social maintenance).
- **Next Ch 16 (old 15):** The philosophical payoff.
