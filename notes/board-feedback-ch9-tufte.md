## Summary
The chapter needs one high-information figure that earns its space. Keep the implicational matrix as the empirical core. Everything else must either (a) show something the prose can't, or (b) be cut. Avoid redundant schematics and bar charts that restate numbers already given in text.

## Keep / Cut
- Keep: Table 9 matrix (noun x property). It shows the triangular pattern immediately.
- Cut or simplify: any threshold diagram that is just a cartoon of the prose.
- Replace: bar charts for corpus counts with a compact table or inline numerals.

## Make the matrix do more work
- Order columns by tight-to-loose (a/an, three, many, agreement).
- Order rows by typicality (book, cattle/police, furniture, water).
- If you keep any extra figure, it should directly explain why the matrix is triangular.

## Optional single schematic (only if it adds real information)
If you need a schematic for the lock/basin idea, make one simple, data-linked diagram:
- A single concentric-ring target labeled with the four construction thresholds.
- Place a few noun types as points along the radius (book at center, cattle mid, furniture outside).
- No gradients, no iconography, no 3D. A clean line drawing is enough.

## Rule of thumb
One chapter, one figure that carries the argument. Everything else should be tables or inline examples.
