# Parked Material from Chapter 2 Refactor

This file contains text cut from `chapters/chapter02.tex` during the redundancy reduction (Jan 2026).
**Strategy:** Reintegrate these chunks into Chapter 3 or Part II where they support the specific argument (mechanism survey, projectibility, etc.) without slowing down the Chapter 2 diagnosis.

## Destination: Chapter 3 (The Mechanistic Turn)

### 1. Islands & Cuneo/Goldberg (Mechanism-first exemplar)
*Context:* Use as an example of what the "mechanism-first reframing" looks like for a specific phenomenon (Islands) when definitions fail.
*From:* Section 2.7 (A Parallel).

> Consider the linguistic case first. Island constraints~-- configurations that resist extraction~-- seemed a paradigm of essentialist success. \textcite{ross1967} identified the patterns: \mention{What did you claim that Mary saw?} is acceptable; \mention{*What did you make the claim that Mary saw?} isn't. The Complex NP Constraint, Coordinate Structure Constraint, Sentential Subject Constraint~-- each named a configuration from which wh-dependencies were blocked. These were genuine discoveries, invisible without systematic analysis.
>
> The essentialist question followed: what defines an island? What structural property constitutes island status? For three decades, generative syntax refined the answer. Subjacency proposed bounding nodes \autocite{chomsky1973}; Barriers elaborated these into richer geometry \autocite{chomsky1986barriers}; phases offered cyclic spell-out domains \autocite{chomsky2001}. Each revision accommodated recalcitrant data while generating new exceptions. The definition kept shifting because the category refused to stabilize.
>
> \textcite{CuneoGoldberg2023Discourse} asked a different question. Not: what structural definition captures islands? But: what mechanism produces extraction resistance? Their answer: long-distance dependencies foreground a constituent~-- the interrogative phrase becomes discourse-prominent~-- while certain constructions background their content. When foregrounding clashes with backgrounding, acceptability degrades. In a preregistered study, two independent measures of backgroundedness predicted acceptability judgments better than structural configuration did. Crucially, judgments were gradient, tracking the severity of the clash. There was no sharp island boundary to define because there was no essence~-- only a mechanism producing variable resistance depending on how severely the functions of the combined constructions conflicted.

### 2. Culicover / Boundary Cases as Evidence (Methodological Maxim)
*Context:* Ch 3 is about what traditions *do* with boundary cases.
*From:* Section 2.6 (The Blocked Question).

> But if you step outside the essentialist framework, boundary cases become the most informative data, as Culicover \autocite*{culicover1999} argues in \textit{Syntactic Nuts}. They are where you can see the mechanisms at work, precisely because the mechanisms are under strain. Phonetic similarity and complementary distribution usually converge; where they don't, you learn something about what maintains phoneme categories. Morphosyntax and semantics usually align; where they don't, you learn something about the mapping between them.

## Destination: Part II (Framework / Kinds Without Essences)

### 3. Quine/Carnap (Methodological Reinforcement)
*Context:* Use in Projectibility/Induction chapter (Part II) to distinguish operational criteria from kind-structure.
*From:* Section 2.2 (Where Essentialism Works).

> Quine's \autocite*{quine1951} critique of Carnap \autocite*{carnap1937} deepens the problem. Carnap thought regimentation was analytically clean: stipulate meanings, derive consequences. Quine denied that any principled line separates stipulated meaning from empirical fact. Definitions carry empirical commitments you didn't intend. The definition of \mention{planet} excluded Pluto~-- a consequence no one anticipated when the criteria were framed. The IAU's definitional agonies were linguistics' own, but with better press coverage.

### 4. Competence/Performance & Biology (Why Biology Doesn't Rescue Essences)
*Context:* Anticipating the "innateness = essence" objection.
*From:* Section 2.2 (Where Essentialism Works).

> The competence/performance distinction was supposed to finesse this. Treat competence as the formal object~-- the thing with essential definitions~-- and performance as noise. This makes linguistics look like mathematics: you study a formal system that happens to be imperfectly realised in behaviour. But if competence is itself a natural phenomenon~-- a cognitive state shaped by acquisition, processing, interaction~-- then it's a natural kind~-- and natural kinds don't have essential definitions but causal structures.
>
> The nativist response is to ground competence in biology: Universal Grammar is genetically specified, so the formal properties are inherited rather than learned. \textcite{baker2003} offers the most sophisticated version of this argument, proposing that lexical categories like noun, verb, and adjective are distinguished by universal syntactic-semantic features~-- essentially necessary conditions for category membership that hold across all languages. If Baker is right, \term{verb} is defined by a feature that licenses a specifier (roughly: verbs are predicates that take subjects), and \term{noun} is defined by being referential. This is modern essentialism, dressed in syntactic vocabulary.
>
> But the appeal to biology points in the wrong direction. Biology is precisely the domain where essentialism was tested and found wanting: species aren't defined by genetic essences but maintained by mechanisms of reproduction, selection, and development. If competence is biological, that's a reason to expect homeostatic structure, not a rescue of essential definitions. Baker's features, if they pick out anything cross-linguistically, may name attractors maintained by functional pressure rather than essences given by Universal Grammar.

### 5. Indeterminacy vs Essence Failure
*Context:* Distinguishing types of failure in HPC framework.
*From:* Section 2.6 (The Blocked Question).

> The first [anomaly] is indeterminacy: the framework can't deliver a yes/no answer. Is this a clause or not? The question seems to demand an answer, and none is forthcoming. Essentialism treats this as a problem to be solved~-- find the right criterion and the answer will emerge. HPC treats it as a prediction: where mechanisms compete, membership is genuinely unsettled. The second is a failure of essence: different candidate essences (VP-headedness, subject-predicate structure) pick out different extensions, and the framework provides no way to adjudicate.
