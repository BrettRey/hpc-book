# Advisory Board Report: Chapter 13 (The Stack)

**Date**: 2026-01-08  
**Scope**: Implementation Plan Review  
**Board Members**: 17

## Decision Record

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Universality (Croft) | Stack = English stabilizer-weighting profile; mechanisms universal |
| Evidence (Tufte) | Each case needs data; figures must show data or be labeled conceptual |

## Tufte's Evidentiary Challenge

> [!WARNING]
> "You're building an elaborate theoretical structure, and I don't yet see what's holding it up."

### Specific Requirements

**Figures**:
- Stack figure: If conceptual, label honestly ("Schematic illustration, not to scale"). If data, show actual vowel formants, regularization curves, corpus frequencies.
- Preferred: Small multiples showing vowel spaces across dialects (merger in progress).

**Per-Case Evidence**:
| Case | Required Data |
|------|---------------|
| /ɪ/–/ɛ/ | Labov formant plots; merger progression data |
| *-ed*/*went* | Regularization rate vs. token frequency (Bybee) |
| *let alone* | Corpus frequency; entrenchment measures |
| Academic register | Corpus data: passive/hedge frequency across registers |

**Negative Cases**: Add 2+ more failures:
- "Indo-European" (historical, not homeostatic)
- "Polysynthetic language" (gradient typological label)
- "The subjunctive" (HPC in decline?)

**Diagnostics**: Make explicit in §13.1 what counts as evidence for HPC at a given level:
1. Properties cluster without definitional link
2. Mechanisms maintain clustering
3. Graded membership
4. Historical mutability

## Integrated Revisions (Rounds 1–5)

| Source | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Godfrey-Smith/Heath | Stabilizer typology (Production/Perception/Storage/Transmission) |
| Millikan/Jackendoff | Transparency → Opacity framing |
| Goldberg | Add schematic case (ditransitive) |
| Zimmer | Hooks, defamiliarization, explicit payoffs |
| Croft | Stack = English profile; cross-ling stress-test |
| **Tufte** | Data requirements per case; more negative cases; honest figure labeling |
