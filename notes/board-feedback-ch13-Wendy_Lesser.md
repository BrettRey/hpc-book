The "coupling gradient" is a compelling architectural spine, but I worry the narrative arc relies too heavily on a mechanical "Hard -> Decoupled -> Re-coupled" progression that feels slightly too convenient. Specifically, the term "Re-coupling" in §13.4 strikes me as rhetorically dangerous. It implies a return to a previous state, as if constructions are merely trying to recapture the innocence of phonemes. They aren't. Constructions are high-level engineered bridges, not atomic fusion. You need to characterize this third stage not as a return, but as a distinct *type* of binding—perhaps "architectural coupling" versus the "atomic coupling" of phonology. The tension shouldn't be about getting back together; it should be about how the *cost* of maintenance increases as you move up the stack.

I am also troubled by labeling §13.2 "The Phonology Exception." If your core claim is scale-invariance, you can't open with an exception; that suggests your theory only works for the middle floors of the building. Phonology shouldn't be an exception; it must be the *limit case*—the point where the semiotic friction is zero because form and function are indistinguishable. Frame it as the bedrock where the physics of sound and the metaphysics of meaning are identical. If you treat it as an outlier, the reader loses faith in the "Stack" before you’ve even laid the bricks for morphology.

Finally, Section 13.6 ("Register at the Wrong Grain") feels like a distraction. You spend five sections building a vertical cathedral, ascending from sound to syntax. To suddenly step sideways into "Register"—only to dismiss it—dissipates the chapter's upward energy. If you need a negative case to prove the boundaries of the theory, it belongs earlier, perhaps as a foil during the discussion of Constructions, or it should be cut entirely to preserve the momentum into Chapter 14. Don't end a chapter about structural integrity by pointing at a pile of rubble; end it on the highest stable beam.
