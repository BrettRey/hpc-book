# Gasparri 2025 — Board Analysis

**Paper**: Gasparri, L. (2025). Bare singular names and genericity. *Journal of Semantics*, 42, 127–135.

**Core finding**: Bare singular names (BSNs) CAN have generic uses, contra the received view. Evidence includes:
- *Italian Andrea is generally male* (demographic)
- *Ruth has good grades in biology* (statistical contexts)
- *Apolline is college-educated* (sociolinguistic)

**Restriction noted**: BSNs allow *characterizing* generics but resist *kind-level* generics (*\*John became common in the 19th century*).

## Millikan Response (confidence: 0.7)

**Key insight**: Generic uses are **derived proper functions**. Names exist for re-identification of token individuals; that's what sustains the practice. Generic uses exploit the fact that naming practices create classes, but this wasn't what names were selected for.

**On the kind-level restriction**: Names don't pick out **natural kinds** with homeostatic mechanisms. They pick out **arbitrary collections** unified only by social convention. You can generalize about tendencies (characterizing), but you can't predicate kind-level properties.

**For Ch 10**: The proper-function framing explains why names are definite (identifiable referents) but non-deital (no form-cluster marking needed because the proper function is already discharged by the name itself).

## Dupré Response (confidence: 0.65)

**Key insight**: The predicativism/referentialism debate is false dichotomy. Names are **multiply classifiable** — referential, predicative, generic — depending on which features we attend to.

**For HPC framework**: Names test whether HPCs require a single mechanism or can tolerate multiple partially-overlapping mechanisms:
- Referential mechanism: discourse practices for re-identification
- Predicative mechanism: metalinguistic awareness of name-classes
- Generic mechanism: statistical generalizations about bearers

These are distinct but overlapping. Names are a paradigm case of multiple co-maintaining mechanisms.

**On "natural" vs "social" kinds**: French naming practices (Apolline vs Kevin) create *social kinds* — looping effects where classification affects the classified. Not arbitrary, but not natural either.

## McCloskey Response (confidence: 0.75)

**Key insight**: Gasparri's paper is a model of **disciplinary judo** — subversion from within.

**The move**: Don't attack orthodoxy head-on. Find one brick that's loose and wiggle it. Make a limited claim that removes a roadblock.

**Rhetorical lessons for the HPC book**:
1. Don't say "essentialism is wrong" — say "here's a phenomenon it handles awkwardly"
2. Use the discipline's own standards of evidence
3. Cite generously, frame fairly, make limited claims
4. Find your "Apolline" — the vivid example everyone recognizes

**Crank/prophet distinction**: Limited claims + invitation for further work = prophet. Grandiose claims + rejecting the discipline = crank.

## Integration Implications

| Insight | Where | How |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Derived proper function | Ch 10 §7.3 | Names are definite by function, non-deital by form — proper function discharged without form-cluster marking |
| Multiple mechanisms | Ch 6 | Names as test case for promiscuous realism about HPCs |
| Social kinds | Ch 4 | Looping effects — naming practices create the kinds they label |
| Rhetorical strategy | Throughout | "One brick at a time" — limited claims, vivid examples |

## Author's Refinement: Evidence Hierarchy

The use/mention objection works for weak examples but fails for strong ones. Gasparri should have separated these more cleanly:

| Strength | Example Type | Verdict |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Strong** | Donkey-anaphora, statistical cases (*Ruth has good grades*) | Genuinely object-language generic |
| **Weak** | Name-catalog (*Regina is noble*), explicit stereotype talk | Looks metalinguistic — "the name Regina connotes nobility" |

**HPC lesson**: Names sit at the intersection of object-language and metalanguage, and the boundary is **gradient**, not sharp. Essentialism wants a clean use/mention line; the data show the line is fuzzy. That's evidence for cluster thinking.
