# Joseph 1991 - Levels of Consciousness in the Knowledge of Language (ED347793) (notes for Ch15)

## What the paper is doing
- Short position paper arguing that *language standards* and *standard languages* require a distinct level of **linguistic consciousness** — reflection on language use — beyond "naive" production.
- Main move: consciousness of language is a **cultural universal** and should be studied scientifically; its marginalization in linguistics is ideological, not methodological.
- Provides a compact theory of standardization (from Joseph 1987) and connects it to Krashen’s Monitor model to explain how standard norms are learned and enforced.

## Key concept: consciousness of language
- Defined as reflective activity about language use by self and others.
- Takes many forms: taboo, rhyme, folk etymology, prescriptive rules, and even formal linguistic theories (GB, etc.).
- Universal across cultures (as universal as religion), but specific forms vary by culture and by individual.
- It is derivative (arises from interaction of language faculty + general reflective cognition), but *this does not make it secondary or scientifically irrelevant*.

## Critique of mainstream linguistics
- "Scientific linguistics" has historically *excluded* language consciousness (prescriptive judgments, standards) as unscientific.
- Joseph calls this exclusion **irrational** and **ideological**, not empirically necessary.
- Result: linguistics mixes data from different levels of consciousness (naive production + conscious correction) and treats them as identical — a methodological error.
- Argument: consciousness of language can be studied objectively; excluding it makes linguistics less scientific, not more.

## Theory of standardization (summary of Joseph 1987)
- Distinguishes **language standards** vs **standard languages**:
  - **Language standards**: normative judgments about correctness; enforced by teachers, editors, grammarians.
  - **Standard language**: a dialect that has acquired a large body of standards and institutional prestige.
- Standardization is not arbitrary; it typically follows a **model language** (Greek → Latin → modern European standards → colonial contexts).
- **Two-phase process**:
  1) **Elaboration**: borrowing and expanding expressive resources; often via translation from model language.
  2) **Control**: regulation and hierarchy of variants; suppression of low variants to enforce uniformity.
- Control is motivated both by efficiency (limiting variation after elaboration) and by unrealistic desire to prevent language change. Sustained control can freeze a standard into a "classical" (dead) language.

## Monogenetic vs polygenetic standardization
- Joseph rejects the structuralist view of standardization as universal/polygenetic.
- Argues for **monogenetic** origin: the Western concept of standard language is historically specific (Greco-Roman + alphabetic writing), later exported globally.
- Important disambiguation: 
  - Universal: *quality judgments* and linguistic consciousness.
  - Historically specific: *the Western model of standard language* (with codification, elite institutions, literacy ideology).
- This reframing avoids the covert idea that non-Western standards are "less developed"; differences are historical trajectories, not cultural deficiency.

## Krashen’s Monitor as a model of linguistic consciousness
- Krashen distinguishes **acquisition** (unconscious rule formation) vs **learning** (conscious study).
- Learned knowledge does not directly generate fluent speech; it functions as a **Monitor** that checks output.
- Joseph adapts this to standardization:
  - Standard language learning = development of a Monitor for one’s *native* dialect.
  - Standards are typically *learned*, not acquired; they are cognitively "unnatural" relative to spontaneous acquisition.
  - The standard is never fully native to anyone; it is a learned overlay on a native dialect.
- Overactive Monitor yields hypercorrection and stylistically stilted, overly formal speech.

## Education and social stratification
- Standard language competence is often treated as general intelligence (Joseph calls this the **cognitive fallacy**).
- School systems reinforce this: high-performing students are encouraged toward free composition (voice), low-performing toward grammar rules (monitoring), entrenching inequality.
- Norms of standard language thus become social gatekeeping tools; educational practices embed stratification under the guise of "ability".

## Relevance to Ch15 (communicative situations, dialects, registers, "native speaker")
- Provides a powerful conceptual tool: **standards are a layer of conscious monitoring**, not the base grammar.
- Supports the claim that "native speaker" competence and standard language competence are different kinds of knowledge (acquired vs learned).
- Reinforces the view that standard languages are **historical, ideological constructions**, not natural outcomes of language evolution.
- Offers a mechanism for register differences: heightened monitoring yields formal styles; low monitoring yields informal styles.
- Fits the HPC line: standards are maintained by social mechanisms (education, ideology, institutions), not by intrinsic linguistic structure.

## Drafting hooks / claims
- "Standards are learned monitors layered onto native systems."  
- "The standard is never fully native; it is a socially enforced overlay."  
- "Linguistic consciousness is universal, but the Western standard language is not."  
- "Treating standardness as intelligence is a category error with political consequences."  

## Cautions
- Joseph does not deny the scientific value of autonomous linguistics; he argues it is incomplete without conscious language study.
- The monogenetic claim is about *the Western standard language model*, not about universal quality judgments.
- Avoid presenting Krashen’s model as empirically settled; Joseph uses it as an explanatory scaffold for standardization.
