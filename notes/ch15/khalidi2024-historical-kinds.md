# Khalidi 2024 - Historical kinds in the social world (notes for Ch15)

## Core idea
- Distinguishes **historical kinds** from **ahistorical causal-functional kinds**.
- Argues that many social kinds are historically individuated (membership depends on origin or trajectory), and that this historical individuation can be epistemically useful and causally explanatory.

## Key distinctions
- **Historical kinds**: membership depends on origin/trajectory (token or type history). Counterfactual test: if an entity had a different origin, would it still be a member of the kind?
- **Token-historical kinds**: tied to a unique historical lineage or origin (single lineage).
- **Type-historical kinds**: arise in different societies but share a type of historical trajectory (multiple independent origins with similar histories).
- **Copied kinds**: a subtype of token-historical kinds where copying or replication is central to identity.
- **Ahistorical causal-functional kinds**: individuated by current function or causal role (no historical requirement).
- **Hybrid kinds**: both historical and functional features matter; history helps explain why current functions exist but is not the only individuator.

## Why historical individuation matters (in social science)
- Supports causal explanation: shared history often explains shared properties.
- Enables inference of common causes and causal pathways.
- Helps explain spatiotemporal distribution and detect exceptions to regularities.
- Allows discovery of new causal regularities that are invisible if you ignore history.

## Implications for social categories
- Institutions like government, marriage, money can be treated as functional kinds, but can also be individuated historically for particular inquiries.
- Social kinds may persist even when current functions diverge from original functions; historical individuation explains continuity.
- Historical individuation is a methodological choice: for some purposes, it is the right way to carve kinds, even if synchronic functional criteria are available.

## Relevance to Ch15
- Dialects, registers, and discourse communities can be framed as historical kinds: their identities depend on trajectories of transmission, migration, and social organization, not just on current feature bundles.
- "Native speaker" status is plausibly historical: linked to a trajectory of acquisition and participation in a community rather than just present competence.
- Communicative situations can be treated as historically stabilized niches; their meaning and norms are partly inherited from earlier social arrangements (type-historical).

## HPC integration
- Historical individuation aligns with HPC: mechanisms and histories stabilize clusters; the historical trajectory is part of why the cluster exists and persists.
- Helps justify why social categories can be real without having strict essences: their unity is diachronic and causal, not purely synchronic.

## Drafting hooks / claims
- "Some social kinds are historical kinds: membership depends on origin or trajectory, not just present properties."
- "History is not an add-on; for many social kinds it is part of the individuation conditions."
- "Dialect and discourse community are not just synchronic bundles; they are lineages of practices."

## Suggested placement in Ch15
- Use in the section on dialect and community to argue that their unity is diachronic (shared trajectory) rather than purely feature-based.
- Use in the "native speaker" discussion to emphasize the role of acquisition trajectory and social history.
- Use in the methodological consequences section to justify historical data (migration, schooling, media regimes) as crucial evidence for kind individuation.

## Cautions
- Khalidi does not claim all social kinds are historical; he advocates a pluralist stance based on explanatory aims.
- Avoid implying that historical individuation makes kinds immutable; he allows functional change and divergence.


## Additional details
- Khalidi's "historical kind" test is counterfactual: if a token had a different origin, would it still be a member of the kind? If no, the kind is historically individuated.
- Token-historical kinds: unique lineages (e.g., a specific institution with an origin event). Type-historical kinds: multiple independent instances that share a type of origin or trajectory (e.g., similar institutions arising in different societies).
- "Copied kinds" are especially relevant for cultural transmission: items whose identity depends on copying (memes, texts, perhaps standard dialect norms). Copying histories matter for individuation.
- Historical properties can be explanatory even if they are not obvious causal properties. They guide inference to common causes, explain distributions, and reveal exceptions.

## Additional Ch15 leverage
- Dialects as copied kinds: repeated transmission of form-meaning pairings across generations yields historical lineage. This helps explain why dialect boundaries can persist even when current feature bundles overlap.
- Registers as type-historical kinds: similar register types (formal writing, casual chat) can arise in many communities because they share a type of communicative trajectory, even without common origin.
- Discourse communities can be treated as historical kinds when they are sustained by lineage of practices (journals, professions, online communities), which makes their linguistic patterns historically individuated.
- This gives a principled way to talk about "native speaker" trajectories: acquisition history and participation in lineage of practices are part of the individuation conditions.
