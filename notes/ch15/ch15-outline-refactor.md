# Ch 15 refactored outline (with hook idea)

## Hook idea (nonfiction, concrete)
- Use Allan Bell’s audience‑design evidence as the opening scene: one broadcaster shifts style as audience changes.
- Emphasize: no new grammar, just a new mix of variants; conditioning changes with audience and situation.
- Pivot line: the unit is conditioning structure P(form | group, situation), not a language.

---

## 1. Hook → Framework pivot
- Hook scene (Bell) → claim that variation is learned via observation of who uses what, where.
- Immediate pivot to conditioning structure as the chapter’s explanatory unit.

## 2. Conditioning structure as backbone (explanatory engine)
- Present Bayesian framing: production as P(Y | X) where X is conditioning variable.
- Indexical meaning = inverse conditioning P(X | Y).
- State explicitly: dialect, register, discourse community are *conditioning structures*, not separate grammars.

## 3. Dialect = durable parameterization
- Dialect as persistent population‑level baseline across contexts.
- Mechanisms: transmission, alignment, network entrenchment.
- Evidence slots: Khalidi 2024 historical kinds; Wiese contact dialect example.
- Diagnostic: dialect effects persist across registers.

## 4. Register = situational reweighting
- Register as context‑conditioned reweighting within the same repertoire.
- Link to com‑sits as situational anchors.
- Pullum for constitutive normativity; O’Connor 2021 for degrees of conventionality.
- Diagnostic: within‑speaker shifts across contexts without changing baseline.

## 5. Discourse community = latent mixture
- Community as latent mixture component with shared expectations.
- Indexical meaning as inverse inference (P(C | Y)).
- Nunberg slurs as community‑normed meaning and looping category.
- Diagnostic: mixture structure beyond dialect/register.

## 6. Standards as conscious overlay
- Joseph 1991: standards are learned monitors layered onto acquisition.
- Haugen’s steps as mechanism chain: selection → codification → acceptance → elaboration.
- Joseph/Rutten/Vosters 2020 critiques integrated as mechanisms: ideology, contact, directionality, maintenance.

## 7. “Native speaker” as mixed kind
- Split competence trajectory vs credential category.
- Khalidi 2015 + Bach 2016: causal vs conventional kinds; avoid objective‑type trap.
- Tie back to conditioning model: label becomes coordination device.

## 8. O’Connor as stability mechanism
- Category salience + coordination yields stable inequities.
- Apply to standards and native‑speaker gatekeeping.
- Models as mechanism sketches, not evidence.

## 9. Diagnostics + falsifiers (bridge to Ch 16)
- Register shifts within speakers; dialect baselines across registers; mixture structure; looping effects; ideology/contact effects.
- Explicit falsifiers: no conditioning effects, no stability patterns, no history dependence.
- Handoff: method consequences in Ch 16 (testing, perturbation, ABMs).
