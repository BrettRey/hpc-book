# Ch 15 advisory board notes - full plan

These notes are written as if each board member reviewed the full outline and offered a page of feedback. The notes are suggestions and questions, not claims of endorsement.

## John Joseph
Joseph would push the chapter to keep the history of standards and the ideology of standardization visible at every step, not quarantined in a late section. He would want the chapter to say early that standards are not just norms but institutional projects that reorganize consciousness. That lets the later "native speaker" section land as a consequence, not a surprise.

He would ask for clarity on the difference between language standards and standard languages. The plan already has this distinction via his 1991 piece, but he would insist that you keep the two terms separate and let them do different work in the chapter. Standards are the conscious monitoring overlay; standard language is the dialect that gained prestige and institutional scaffolding. He would want a sentence that says this in plain language before you move into the com-sit framework.

He would likely ask you to historicize "standard" in the chapter's own terms. If your plan treats standards as a mechanism, he will ask when that mechanism enters the scene and why. His line would be monogenetic: the Western standard language model is historically specific. You can keep your framework universal but make the standardization story local and historical. He would want the hook to show this: a concrete, nonfiction moment of standardization, like a schoolroom correction, a grammar examination, or a state decree. He would underline the warning you gave: if the hook is a story, it must be nonfiction and concrete.

He would also want you to keep the "cognitive fallacy" in view: the tendency to equate standardness with intelligence. He would push you to use this as an explicit motivation for the chapter. It connects the standardization section to the inequity section and ensures the political consequences do not look bolted on. That might be one of your chapter's key payoff moments.

Questions he would ask:
First, do you distinguish between standards that are learned and those that are acquired by immersion? His point is that the standard is rarely fully native, and that difference is structural, not just educational. Second, do you show how standardization reshapes the epistemology of the field? He would want a sentence that says linguistics has ignored consciousness of language because of ideology, not because the data are unscientific.

He would also suggest that you use his Monitor framing to link register to consciousness. Formal register is a Monitoring regime; informal register is low Monitoring. That helps you keep register in the same explanatory plane as standardization, rather than treating it as a separate topic.

## Joseph Heath
Heath would focus on the inequity mechanism. He would want you to treat the O'Connor material as explanatory rather than illustrative. Category salience plus coordination is not just a warning. It is a mechanism of social stability. He would ask you to show how that mechanism connects to dialect prestige and to the "native speaker" gatekeeping effect. This can be done without moralizing. The point is causal.

Heath would push you to separate descriptive and normative claims in your prose. If you are showing how inequity stabilizes, he will want to avoid language that sounds like an accusation. The chapter should sound like a mechanism explanation, not a manifesto. That is consistent with your house style.

He would likely ask for one small, concrete example of category-based coordination. It could be a classroom correction, a hiring screen, or a phone interview. He will want it to be nonfiction and short. The example should show how a category becomes a coordination device even when no one explicitly endorses it.

Heath would also ask you to guard against overreach with game models. He tends to be skeptical of models that are treated as evidence. Your ABM philosophy is already a fit. But he would want one sentence that says the models are mechanism sketches, not proof.

Questions he would ask:
First, is the inequity mechanism tied to communicative situations, or is it just general social coordination? You should show how the com-sit frame makes the mechanism more precise. Second, is there a clear bridge from inequity to the methodological handoff in Ch 16? He would want the chapter to end with a diagnostic, not just a warning.

## Ruth Millikan
Millikan would lock onto normativity. She would ask whether you are using normativity in her proper-function sense or in a looser practice sense. If you take Pullum's constitutive rule framing, she will want you to show how those rules arise from historical function. That is her entry point.

She would ask if the com-sit framework allows you to define proper functions for social varieties. For example, does a register have a proper function in her sense, or is it just a conventional coordination device? She may say that registers have proper functions when they reliably solve recurrent interactional problems, and she would ask you to say this explicitly.

She would caution you against treating norms as purely sociological without a causal history. She would want you to show that standards are not just imposed but maintained because they deliver certain functions for institutions. That does not justify them, but it explains their persistence, which is her main interest.

She would also ask how "native speaker" can be treated as a proper-function category. If the function is to indicate a history of acquisition and a predictable competence profile, then it is a kind with a function. But if it is a credential category enforced by institutions, then it is closer to a conventional kind. She would want you to separate these two.

Questions she would ask:
First, what is the proper function of a dialect in your framework? Is it to coordinate within a network, or to index identity, or both? If both, you need to explain how dual functions interact without collapsing into a vague list. Second, can you show the historical pathway by which a register becomes a standard? That is the kind of etiological story she values.

## John Dupre
Dupre would press the chapter to embrace pluralism without slipping into nominalism. He would endorse your conditioning-structure model if you are explicit that multiple overlapping categories can be real for different purposes. He will want you to state that there is no single correct carving of the social variety space.

He would likely ask you to keep the tone in the dialect/register/community sections descriptive, not prescriptive. He will respond well to phrases like "right-sized for a purpose" and "projectible relative to goals". That is a direct fit with your field-relative projectibility line.

He would also encourage you to treat com-sits as a practical ontology. They are not metaphysically privileged. They are the right unit because they solve a specific explanatory problem. That is his style of realism.

He would push you to avoid the trap of arguing that languages are "not real". He would prefer "not foundational" or "not the primary unit for grammar". That keeps the argument pluralist, not eliminative.

Questions he would ask:
First, how do you keep your social variety categories empirically grounded if they are purpose-relative? You need a diagnostic list, which you already plan. He would want that list to be explicit and falsifiable. Second, what prevents the com-sit model from turning into a catch-all? The answer is the same: clear diagnostics and predictive use.

## Ian Hacking
Hacking would ask where the looping effects are. If "native speaker" is a category that changes how people behave, then it is a classic human kind. He would want a short passage that makes this explicit. He would want to see how standards and registers loop: once a label exists, people adjust to it, and the category changes.

He would also want you to mark which categories are human kinds and which are closer to natural kinds. Dialects and registers likely fall into the human-kind zone, where classifications affect the classified. He would ask you to show what happens when a community is named, or when a register is labeled "professional". That changes behavior, which in turn changes the variety.

He would be sensitive to how you talk about slurs. He would want Nunberg used as a case of classification feeding back into social reality. The category "slur" is itself a historical creation; that is a perfect example of looping.

Questions he would ask:
First, are there looping effects in grammatical categories themselves, or only in social categories? Your plan could say that grammatical categories have weaker looping effects, but social categories have strong ones. Second, can your conditioning-structure model represent looping? It can if you allow the conditioning variables to change as a result of labeling. You might want one sentence that makes this possibility explicit.

## Adele Goldberg
Goldberg would be sympathetic to com-sits and mixture models because they align with usage-based learning. But she would push you to keep the grammar story in view. If you spend too long on social kinds without returning to form-meaning pairings, she will think the chapter has drifted away from linguistics.

She would want you to show how a construction's distribution changes across com-sits, not just how dialect and register shift. That gives her something concrete to recognize. It would also help tie this chapter to the previous ones.

She would ask you to avoid overemphasizing "categories" in the abstract. Her view favors constructions and families of constructions, which align with the conditioning-structure model. She would likely suggest that you frame some of the dialect and register effects as shifts in constructional preferences.

Questions she would ask:
First, where are the constructional examples? You should have one or two. Second, how does the conditioning model handle partial productivity, like semi-productive register markers? That is a usage-based signature and a good place for a brief paragraph.

## Ray Jackendoff
Jackendoff would push on architecture. He would ask where the com-sit layer sits in the grammar. Is it part of the interface, or a parallel tier? You can use his parallel architecture as a friendly frame: com-sit information is a parallel stream that interfaces with syntax and semantics.

He would want you to be precise about what "value" means in a social context. In Ch 14 it was structural meaning. Here it is social meaning. He would ask you to distinguish them clearly so the chapter does not feel like it smuggles in a new meaning of "value" without notice.

He would also likely ask you to say explicitly that social conditioning does not imply multiple grammars. That line is in Wiese. He would like to hear it again. It will also help keep the argument within a formalist audience's tolerance.

Questions he would ask:
First, do you allow for rule-like constraints in the com-sit layer, or is it purely probabilistic? He will be looking for whether your model can capture categorical judgments in certain registers. Second, can you show how the com-sit layer interacts with phonology and morphology, not just syntax? A sentence could mention that register effects are visible at multiple levels.

## Peter Godfrey-Smith
Godfrey-Smith would interrogate the biology parallel. He would want to know if the mechanism similarities are more than metaphor. He would ask for one concrete mapping: what in social variation corresponds to stabilizers in biological populations?

He would likely ask whether dialects are more like species or like ecological niches. Your conditioning-structure framing suggests niches, not species. He would probably like that, but he would want you to say it explicitly and avoid suggesting too strong a species analogy.

He would also ask whether you can distinguish between social stabilizers that are causal mechanisms versus those that are just conventions. This aligns with Khalidi. He will want the causality clear.

Questions he would ask:
First, are there genuine analogues of selection and drift? If so, put a short phrase in the dialect section. Second, does the com-sit framework allow for multiple overlapping ecologies, and do you show how that is stable? That is the ecological angle he cares about.

## Ewa Dabrowska
Dabrowska would focus on individual differences. She would want a sentence that says "the grammar" varies across speakers in ways that are systematic and persistent. This supports the claim that categories are maintained at the community level rather than a single mental grammar.

She would push you to avoid assuming uniform competence. That is crucial for the "native speaker" section. If you treat native competence as a single cluster, she will object. She would rather you show that "native" is a distribution, not a point.

She might suggest a brief nod to experimental evidence that shows variation in grammatical knowledge. You do not need to cite her directly in the chapter if it does not fit, but a sentence acknowledging individual variance will keep the argument honest.

Questions she would ask:
First, do your diagnostics allow for wide individual variance? They should. Second, is your conditioning model flexible enough to treat speaker-level differences as more than noise? It is, but you should say that individual variation is part of the cluster, not a threat to it.

## Emily Bender
Bender would ask how your social kinds framework intersects with NLP and language models. She would worry that people will read your cluster story as license to treat statistical patterns as natural categories. She will want you to be explicit that usage distributions do not justify essentialist labels.

She would also challenge the "native speaker" category. In her view, it is an ideological category that bakes in power, and models trained on standard corpora will reproduce it. She would want you to say this in the inequity section and to frame it as a mechanism problem, not just bias.

She would like your conditioning-structure model because it treats distributions as context-dependent. But she will want you to avoid the claim that models discover true categories. They infer clusters relative to data and objectives. That is a form of field-relative projectibility, which is your own core claim.

Questions she would ask:
First, how will you prevent readers from reifying the mixture components in your model? You should add a sentence that says components are analyst constructs tied to explanatory aims. Second, can you flag how data selection shapes the clusters? If the data are standard language heavy, the model will look like a "native speaker" model. That should be called out.

## Deirdre McCloskey
McCloskey would read this as a discipline-facing chapter and would look for signs of stance. She would tell you to avoid either preaching or apologizing. The tone should be confident, precise, and generous. She will call out any passage that sounds like you're scolding linguists.

She would also insist on a tangible payoff. The chapter should not just describe how social varieties stabilize. It should show why that matters for how we do linguistics. Your diagnostic list is the right place, but she would ask that it be written as a practical set of consequences, not an abstract list.

She will ask you to make the hook work as rhetoric. Since you note that any story must be nonfiction and concrete, she will want you to pick one that is also legible to non-specialists. A small classroom correction or a job interview moment might do this.

Questions she would ask:
First, does each section move the argument, or is some of it background? She will push you to cut background that doesn't pay rent. Second, does the chapter clearly say what changes for the reader's own practice? She will want the final paragraph to make that explicit.

## Wendy Lesser
Lesser will cut throat-clearing and ask you to move the best sentence earlier. She will want the hook to be human, concrete, and in the first page. She will also prefer shorter paragraphs, especially in the com-sit framework section.

She will dislike any abstract preface that delays the point. She will push you to begin with the scene and only then introduce the theory. She will also flag any jargon that arrives before it is motivated. Terms like com-sit and conditioning structure should come after a concrete example.

Questions she would ask:
First, can you compress the dialect/register/community section into a single narrative arc instead of three parallel definitions? She might prefer an unfolding structure: start with a specific interaction and show how each layer explains it. Second, are there two or three sentences that could be removed without loss? She will want them gone.

## Carl Zimmer
Zimmer would help you find the concrete image that makes the social stabilization feel real. He will also insist the hook be nonfiction and concrete, not a stylized thought experiment. A real instance of standardization enforcement or register switching would be ideal.

He would push you to show mechanisms at work. If you say "maintenance" or "entrenchment" without showing a real‑world instantiation, he will see it as hand‑waving. A short vignette of how a correction spreads, or how a register is enforced by a gatekeeper, would make the mechanism visible.

He will want to see why com-sits are a better unit than languages. This is an abstract claim that needs a striking example. The Wiese markets example is strong. He would encourage you to use it early.

Questions he would ask:
First, which exact case will you lead with, and can you verify it is real? Second, can you show at least one small piece of observational data, even if anecdotal? He values visible, concrete evidence.

## Edward Tufte
Tufte would ask whether you need a figure. If you include one, it should be minimal, data-rich, and tied to a claim that cannot be said in words as well. A simple schematic showing conditioning structure could be acceptable if it carries analytic weight.

He would dislike any figure that is decorative or metaphorical. If you show the com-sit model, he will want the labels to carry explanatory content, not just aesthetics.

Questions he would ask:
First, does the chapter include a figure that earns its space? If not, drop it. Second, if you include a figure, does it tie directly to a falsifiable claim? If not, it is chartjunk.

## Howard Becker
Becker would focus on how you address the discipline. He will warn you not to attack the tribe. He will want you to show that you are offering a new way to see something they already care about, not a dismissal of their work.

He would also push you to make your definitions operational. "Dialect," "register," and "community" should be defined in ways that scholars can use. Your conditioning-structure model helps, but he will want you to show how it translates into actual research steps.

Questions he would ask:
First, do you show how someone could test your claims with their own data? That should be explicit in the diagnostics section. Second, do you acknowledge the practical constraints of sociolinguistic work, like limited data or access? If not, add one sentence to show you understand the real field conditions.

## Errol Morris
Morris would ask how you portray essentialists and prescriptivists. If they look like villains, he will push you to humanize them. He prefers a narrative where reasonable people got trapped by a framework, not caricatures.

He would also want the hook to have a point of view. A true story told from inside a situation can make the shift in perspective feel earned rather than imposed. If you open with a school correction or a job interview, he will ask whose eyes we are seeing it through.

Questions he would ask:
First, who is the human face in the chapter? A student, a teacher, a gatekeeper, a bilingual speaker? He will want one. Second, does the ending offer a way forward, not just critique? The transition to Ch 16 should feel like a path, not just a warning.
