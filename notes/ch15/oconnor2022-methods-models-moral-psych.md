# O'Connor 2022 - Methods, models, and the evolution of moral psychology (notes for Ch15)

## Core purpose of the paper
- Methodological overview for studying the evolution of moral psychology, with two main claims:
  1) We must triangulate sparse empirical data with formal evolutionary models.
  2) Game-theoretic models are especially useful because moral traits evolve to solve strategic social problems.

## Structure of the paper (useful orientation)
- Section 2: methodological issues (sparse data, underdetermination, need for modeling).
- Section 3: worked example using guilt (shows how models plus empirical evidence can explain a trait).
- Section 4: survey of strategic scenarios (PD, Stag Hunt, bargaining, coordination) that shape moral psychology.

## Key methodological claims
- Historical sciences (including human psychology) face sparse, noisy evidence; explanation is underdetermined.
- Modeling helps constrain narratives and test which evolutionary stories are plausible.
- Models by themselves explain behavior, not psychology. To connect to psychology, you need independent empirical evidence about candidate traits.
- Best practice is triangulation: model results + empirical data + careful interpretation.

## Games as evolutionary problem-types
- Prisoner's dilemma (cooperation under temptation).
- Stag hunt (coordination and assurance).
- Bargaining games (division of resources, fairness norms).
- Coordination games (conventions, signaling, shared meanings).
- Moral emotions and norms evolve as solutions to these recurring strategic problems.

## Example: guilt
- Guilt can be modeled as a commitment device that stabilizes cooperation.
- Models show how guilt can evolve because it changes incentives and signals reliability.
- Empirical findings about guilt (psychology, development) are needed to make this more than a behavior-only story.

## Relevance to Ch15 (communicative situations, dialects, registers)
- Provides a methodological justification for using game-theoretic and cultural-evolution models to explain sociolinguistic norms.
- Communicative situations can be framed as recurring strategic contexts (coordination games, signaling games, bargaining games over social meaning).
- Norms around dialect/register choice can be modeled as stable strategies that solve social coordination problems (e.g., signaling group identity, managing politeness, avoiding conflict).

## How to use in Ch15
- Use O'Connor to justify modeling sociolinguistic categories as emergent conventions shaped by strategic interactions, not just static structures.
- Cite the triangulation principle: do not rely only on social theory or only on models; integrate empirical evidence with formal mechanisms.
- This supports the claim that communicative situations are the locus where norms evolve (because those situations are the recurring strategic problems).

## Drafting hooks
- "Models can show how norms could evolve; empirical data show which norms did evolve. We need both."
- "Communicative situations are not just contexts; they are recurring strategic games."
- "Norms stabilize where the strategic problem is stable."

## Cautions
- O'Connor focuses on moral psychology, not language. Use as methodological analogy rather than direct evidence.
- Be explicit that models address behavior; psychological mechanisms must be inferred cautiously.


## Additional methodological angles
- She emphasizes that modeling can rule out attractive narratives: even plausible stories about trait evolution can fail in models, which improves explanatory discipline.
- Models should match the type of strategic situation a trait is supposed to solve. The wrong game type yields misleading conclusions.
- The same trait can be modeled in multiple games, but explanatory power depends on how well the game captures the real social structure.

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- Provides a principled way to select modeling tools for sociolinguistics: choose games that match the communicative situation (coordination for shared meanings, signaling for identity, bargaining for politeness/facework).
- Encourages explicit epistemic status statements: model is a mechanism sketch, not direct evidence. This matches the book's ABM philosophy.


## Additional content useful for analogy
- She lists the canonical games and the kinds of psychological traits they might explain:
  - PD -> cooperation, altruism, guilt, punishment.
  - Stag hunt -> assurance, trust, group coordination.
  - Bargaining -> fairness norms, resentment, status sensitivity.
  - Coordination/signaling -> shared meanings, conventions, social emotions.
- This inventory can be reinterpreted for communicative situations: the "moral psychology" analog becomes "sociolinguistic psychology" (norms about appropriateness, politeness, prestige).

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- The chapter can borrow her triangulation stance to justify using both ethnographic evidence (how people talk) and formal models (coordination dynamics).
- This makes it easier to claim that communicative situations are mechanisms, not just settings.
