# Pullum 2019 - Formalism, grammatical rules, and normativity (notes for Ch15)

## Core thesis
- Grammar is fundamentally normative: a grammar expresses what is correct or incorrect, not just a statistical description.
- Generative grammar does not contain "rules" in the usual normative sense (rules that can be followed or violated). But normativity can still be formalized without generative rules.
- Normativity in grammar does not imply prescriptive moral obligation; it is closer to constitutive rules (like rules of chess) that define correctness within a practice.

## Key distinctions
- **Normative vs prescriptive**:
  - Normative: statements that define correctness within a system (e.g., adjective order in French). These give reasons for use but are not moral commands.
  - Prescriptive: attempts to force change or enforce a preferred standard; these are advisory and often arbitrary.
- **Constitutive vs regulative rules (Searle)**:
  - Constitutive rules define the practice (grammar is closer to this).
  - Regulative rules govern an already defined practice (prescriptive grammar).

## Pullum's view of grammaticality
- Grammaticality judgments are not just corpus facts; they generalize beyond observed data and thus have a normative aspect.
- A grammar is not a list of past behaviors. It is a system of constraints that defines which expressions are well-formed.
- This normativity is compatible with empirical linguistics: the rules can be formalized and tested without treating them as moral obligations.

## Formalism and normativity
- Pullum traces formalism in logic (Post, Lewis) to show that precise formal systems can capture rules without relying on meaning.
- He argues we can formalize normative grammatical constraints in similar ways, not necessarily through generative grammar.
- Normativity in grammar does not require metaphysical normativity; it can be understood as "correctness within a practice".

## Relevance to Ch15
- Supports the claim that linguistic norms are real and systematic, not merely prescriptive ideology.
- Useful for framing "native speaker" and "standard": the norms are constitutive of practices, but they are not moral obligations.
- Helps separate sociolinguistic normativity (community standards) from prescriptive policing. This matters for dialect and register: a community can have normative rules without being prescriptive.

## Integration with communicative situations
- Normativity can be tied to com-sits: what is "correct" is relative to the communicative situation and the practice it defines.
- This dovetails with the idea that norms are situation-conditioned and community-maintained (HPC mechanisms).

## Drafting hooks
- "Grammaticality is normative but not prescriptive."  
- "Rules of grammar are like rules of chess: they define correctness within a practice."  
- "A descriptive grammar can be normative without giving moral commands."  

## Suggested placement in Ch15
- Use in the "native speaker" or normativity section to argue that judgments of correctness are practice-based, not moralized.
- Use when distinguishing dialectal norms from prescriptive standards: both are normative in Pullum's sense, but only the latter is prescriptive.

## Cautions
- Do not suggest Pullum endorses prescriptivism; he explicitly separates descriptive normativity from prescriptive correction.
- His argument is about grammar as a practice, not about defending any particular standard variety.


## Additional details
- Pullum argues that grammatical norms are constitutive: they define the practice of using a grammar, analogous to how chess rules define chess.
- He emphasizes that descriptive grammar can state normative constraints without prescribing social behavior. Normativity here is about correctness within a system, not about moral obligation.
- The point about corpus data: grammar cannot be reduced to corpus frequency because grammaticality covers an infinite range of potential expressions.
- He notes that prescriptivists confuse regulative rules (social exhortations) with constitutive rules (system-defining constraints).
- He also indicates that normativity may not apply to Universal Grammar as such; UG might be a non-normative domain even if particular grammars are normative.

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- Use the constitutive-rule framing to explain why community norms about dialect/register are not mere "preferences"; they define what counts as correct within a practice.
- Distinguish this from institutional prescriptivism (style guides, schools), which is regulative and often ideology-driven.
- Useful for a "native speaker" section: correctness judgments are practice-relative, not inherently tied to prestige.


## Additional points to mine
- Pullum pushes back against views that grammaticality is just usage frequency. Grammar makes generalizations over an unbounded set of potential utterances, so correctness is not reducible to corpus facts.
- He argues that rules with normative force can be made formally precise without invoking a generative rule system, which opens space for alternative formalizations.
- He notes that normativity does not require "ought" in the moral sense; it can be understood as reasons for use within a practice.

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- Use to clarify that speech community norms are not simply "preferences"; they are constitutive constraints that give a practice its structure.
- Use to contrast descriptive normativity (community grammar) with prescriptive authority (schools, style guides), a distinction that will matter for "native speaker" debates.
