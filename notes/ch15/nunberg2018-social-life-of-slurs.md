# Nunberg 2018 - The social life of slurs (notes for Ch15)

## Core perspective
- Nunberg treats slurs as a social and historical phenomenon, not merely a semantic one. The category "slur" is itself historically recent and culturally loaded.
- The meaning and force of slurs are bound to social practices, power relations, and group identities; they are not reducible to simple lexical content.

## Key claims
- The noun "slur" (as a linguistic category) enters mainstream English only in the mid-20th century. Its rise tracks shifts in moral and political discourse (civil rights era, new norms of linguistic self-determination).
- Slurs are best understood as culturally saturated keywords. Their social meaning depends on community norms, historical oppression, and the status of targets.
- Treating slurs as purely linguistic kinds (like "proper name" or "factive verb") is a category mistake; they are closer to rhetorical and social categories.

## Slurs as social practices
- Slurs are hybrid: they categorize a group and express derogatory stance. This is not just semantic content; it is an act embedded in social relations.
- Offensive force is not uniform across time or communities. It depends on social history, uptake, and ongoing power relations.
- The existence of slurs for a group tracks social salience and social antagonism, not just linguistic structure.

## Neutral counterparts and reclamation
- The idea of a "neutral counterpart" is shaky: neutrality is cultural, not purely semantic.
- Slurs can be reclaimed by in-group use; reclaimed uses can develop new meanings and broadened extensions.
- Reclamation shows that the social practice around a term can change without altering the referential core, underscoring the social nature of meaning.

## Conventionality and metadata
- Slurs rely on shared community knowledge about their derogatory status; dictionaries often mark them with metadata labels like "offensive".
- Offensiveness can persist even when speakers disavow intent, because the word is embedded in social conventions.
- This helps explain why slurs can be offensive in quotation, indirect mention, or denial contexts.

## Social category formation
- The slur category itself is historically constructed: prior to the mid-20th century, English had derogatory terms but lacked a category that unified them as "slurs".
- This shows how social categories can emerge through changing moral vocabularies and institutional norms.

## Relevance to Ch15
- Provides a vivid case where linguistic meaning is inseparable from communicative situations, norms, and social categories.
- Supports the claim that social categories (including "native speaker" and "standard") are stabilized by norms and institutions, not just by structural linguistic facts.
- Illustrates how discourse communities and registers can define what counts as acceptable or offensive usage; com-sits and community norms shape interpretation.

## HPC connections
- Slurs are a good example of a socially stabilized kind where the cluster is not purely structural; it is maintained by social mechanisms (norms, policing, institutional labeling, group identity).
- This fits the HPC idea that a category can be real because it is maintained, even if it lacks a clean essence.

## Drafting hooks / claims
- "Slurs are not just words with bad meanings; they are social practices anchored in history and power."
- "The category 'slur' is itself historically recent, showing that linguistic categories can be socially engineered."
- "Offensiveness is a community-level norm, not a private intention."

## Suggested placement in Ch15
- Use in the discourse community section to show how community norms determine category membership and acceptability.
- Use in the "native speaker" or normativity section to demonstrate how social categories determine correctness and offense beyond formal grammar.
- Use as a case study to argue for communicative situation-based interpretation (same form different effect in different com-sits).

## Cautions
- Do not imply Nunberg reduces slurs to mere sociological phenomena; he engages semantic debates but insists social history is central.
- Avoid overstating that slurs are "purely" conventional; he treats them as socially embedded linguistic items with stable patterns, but socially mediated.


## Additional details worth surfacing
- Nunberg critiques accounts that treat slurs as truth-conditional or as simple semantic operators ("neutral term + negative attitude"). He argues this misses the social embedding and historical trajectory of these terms.
- He distinguishes slurs from other pejoratives and hybrid evaluatives (e.g., "idiot", "bitch") and shows that the social category of slur is partly a moral and political innovation.
- The offensiveness of a slur does not depend entirely on speaker intent; it relies on community knowledge and conventional social meaning.
- In-group reclamation is not just a change in attitude; it can generate new meanings and new extensions. This demonstrates that linguistic categories can be re-engineered through social practice.
- He emphasizes that what counts as "neutral" is itself historically and politically contingent (e.g., the evolution of race terms), which undermines simple semantic treatments.

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- Use slurs as a case study for how discourse communities create and enforce local norms (what counts as unacceptable, taboo, or in-group acceptable). This parallels register/dialect norms.
- The emergence of "slur" as a category shows how metalanguage itself can become a social kind, which ties into the chapter's theme of social stabilization.
- Reclamation and taboo illustrate how communicative situations can flip evaluative meaning without changing referential content; this supports a com-sit-based semantics/pragmatics view.
