# O'Connor 2022 - Why Natural Social Contracts are Not Fair (notes for Ch15)

## Core thesis
- Cultural evolutionary models often predict fair norms in bargaining games, but when social categories are introduced, inequity is the robust outcome.
- Fairness is not the default once category-based coordination is possible; discriminatory norms emerge easily and persist.

## Baseline model: fairness without categories
- Nash demand game shows equal splits are stable equilibria.
- Cultural evolution (learning, imitation, reinforcement) can lead to fair conventions because they are efficient and stable.

## What changes when social categories are added
- When agents recognize and condition behavior on categories (race, gender, status), new equilibria appear.
- These equilibria can be discriminatory: one category consistently receives more in bargaining.
- Minimal conditions for inequity:
  1) Individuals recognize social categories.
  2) They condition their behavior on category membership.
  3) They adapt in ways that improve their own payoff.
- Power asymmetries, minority status, and group size differences stabilize inequity further.

## Implications and takeaways
- Inequity is a stable and predictable outcome of category-based coordination, not an anomaly.
- Fairness is fragile: even small category cues can create coordination on unfair outcomes.
- Norms of fairness in real societies require active maintenance and structural interventions.

## Relevance to Ch15
- Supports the idea that categories (dialect, register, "native speaker") are not neutral; they can become coordination loci for unequal social outcomes.
- Explains why stigmatized varieties persist: discriminatory norms can be stable equilibria once categories are socially salient.
- Provides a mechanism for how "native speaker" or "standard" can become a gatekeeping tool: once a category is salient, institutions coordinate on it.

## Links to communicative situations
- Communicative situations are coordination problems. If category labels are salient in a com-sit, the equilibrium can shift toward unequal norms (e.g., who gets to speak, who is treated as authoritative, which variant is "appropriate").
- This helps connect register/dialect choice to social power: norms are not just about efficiency, they are about stable coordination under asymmetry.

## HPC integration
- Shows how social categories can act as stabilizing mechanisms: once a category is salient, it anchors repeated patterns of behavior (a homeostatic cluster).
- But the cluster can be maladaptive or unjust; stability is not a sign of fairness.

## Drafting hooks
- "As soon as categories become salient, coordination can stabilize inequity."  
- "Fairness is not the default; it is a fragile equilibrium that must be maintained."  
- "Stigma and prestige are stable conventions, not noise."  

## Suggested placement in Ch15
- Use in the "native speaker" / standard language section to explain why such categories generate persistent inequities.
- Use in the dialect/register section to show how social meaning and power attach to varieties through coordination dynamics.

## Cautions
- This is about bargaining norms, not language directly. Treat it as an analogical mechanism for how category-based norms stabilize in communicative contexts.
- Do not overclaim that all inequity in language follows from these models; use them as explanatory scaffolding.


## Additional details
- The Nash demand game is the canonical model: multiple equilibria exist, but equal splits dominate under symmetry.
- When categories are introduced, they provide coordination signals that make unequal equilibria focal.
- The results are robust across variations: group size differences, power asymmetries, and interaction structure intensify inequity.
- O'Connor emphasizes policy implications: structural changes and material redistribution are more effective than purely normative exhortation.

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- In linguistic contexts, category labels ("native speaker", "standard") are exactly the kind of coordination signals that models show can stabilize inequity.
- This gives a mechanism for why linguistic gatekeeping is stable even when unjust: it is an equilibrium, not a mere prejudice.
- Use this to argue that sociolinguistic norms are not neutral coordination tools; they can encode persistent inequities.


## Additional points to mine
- The paper surveys how inequitable norms can emerge from very small asymmetries (initial conditions, small power differences) and then lock in through learning.
- It highlights the role of category recognition itself: once categories exist, they become coordination devices, and coordination can be on fairness or unfairness.
- She emphasizes that inequity is not a rare bug but a robust feature of learning dynamics when categories are salient.

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- This can ground a claim about "native speaker" hierarchy: once the category is recognized, institutions can coordinate on it for access, and the inequity becomes self-stabilizing.
- It also supports a claim about register policing: when formality categories are salient, groups can coordinate on exclusionary norms (e.g., "professional" register as gatekeeping).
