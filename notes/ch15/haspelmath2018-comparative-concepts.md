# Haspelmath 2018 - Comparative concepts vs descriptive categories (notes for Ch15)

## Core distinction
- Haspelmath insists on a strict distinction between:
  1) Descriptive linguistic categories: language-particular categories defined within a single language's system.
  2) Comparative concepts: cross-linguistic tools defined in substantive/etic terms for comparison.
- The two are ontologically different. Comparative concepts are researcher-constructed tools, not kinds that exist independently of the comparison.

## Main motivations
- Cumulativity and replicability in linguistics require clarity about what terms mean.
- Using the same label for a language-specific category and a comparative concept encourages a category fallacy: assuming a language-particular category is an instance of a universal kind.
- Unlike everyday categories ("boyfriend", "tea"), linguistic categories across unrelated languages do not share a causal link. Similarities do not ground a shared natural kind.

## The "general category" fallacy
- Saying a language-specific construction is an instance of a general category (e.g., "progressive") does not, by itself, add explanatory content about the language.
- In linguistics, cross-linguistic categories are not natural kinds. They are comparative tools defined by the investigator.
- Thus, cross-linguistic claims should be interpreted as claims about phenomena of languages (patterns we observe), not about the internal categories of those languages.

## Comparative concepts as social categories
- Haspelmath explicitly treats linguistic categories as a type of social category rather than as natural kinds.
- Comparative concepts are portable across languages because they are defined by substantive criteria, not by language-internal system membership.
- Some comparative concepts resemble language-specific categories (category-like comparative concepts), but similarity does not erase the conceptual distinction.

## Typology and commensurability
- Comparative concepts are needed for typology, but they require careful definition and do not imply that languages share a single underlying category.
- Languages are often incommensurable at category level; comparative concepts are the bridge, not the proof of sameness.

## Relevance to Ch15 (communicative situations, dialects, registers, "native speaker")
- Supports the idea that "language" itself is not a natural kind in the strict sense but a socially constructed category. This fits the argument that named languages and "native speaker" are sociolinguistic indices, not deep ontological kinds.
- Provides a methodological caution: do not treat "dialect", "register", or "discourse community" as fixed universal kinds without specifying the comparative concept being used.
- Helps motivate a shift from language-based ontology to situation-based ontology: if categories are not cross-linguistic kinds, then communicative situations (and their mechanisms) become the better grounding units.

## Integration points with HPC framework
- Field-relative projectibility: Haspelmath's distinction aligns with the idea that projectibility depends on the analytic purpose. Comparative concepts are tools for a purpose; descriptive categories are language-internal.
- HPC lens: if language categories are social kinds rather than natural kinds, we should expect them to be stabilized by mechanisms (transmission, alignment, institutional norms) rather than by essential features.

## Drafting hooks / usable claims
- "Comparative concepts are tools; descriptive categories are system-internal. Conflating them makes typology look stronger than it is."
- "Cross-linguistic categories are not natural kinds; they are analytic instruments."
- "Named language categories are social categories, not ontological givens."

## How to use in Ch15
- In the section on "native speaker" or language borders, cite Haspelmath to argue that categories like "noun" or "progressive" are not universal natural kinds; they are comparative concepts used for cross-language work.
- In the register/dialect section, use Haspelmath to justify treating these as constructed categories that require explicit criteria, rather than as natural species-like kinds.
- In the methodological consequences section, emphasize that the choice of comparative concept is a choice of purpose, not a discovery of a pre-existing category.

## Cautions
- Haspelmath is not denying that language-specific categories are real; he is denying that cross-linguistic categories automatically track them.
- Do not present him as a radical eliminativist; he is a methodological pluralist who wants explicit definitions at the comparative level.


## Additional details worth noting
- He distinguishes **category-like comparative concepts** (e.g., "subject", "progressive", "reduplication") from **etic comparative concepts** (e.g., frequency measures, phonetic scales) that are less likely to be mistaken for natural kinds.
- He notes that comparative concepts are widely used across sciences. They are not social kinds; they are analytic tools that allow comparison across otherwise incommensurable systems.
- The generative assumption he pushes against: that categories are innate natural kinds that only manifest differently across languages. He argues this is methodologically ungrounded.
- He concedes there are special cases where a unitary description is possible (e.g., closely related languages, heavy contact), but this does not erase the conceptual distinction. It just makes the comparative concept unusually close to language-specific categories.
- "Non-portable" terms: many language-specific category labels do not travel well across languages. This underlines that category labels are not universal kinds.

## Concrete implications for the chapter's framing
- When discussing dialect and register, treat their definitions as analytic choices rather than discoveries of pre-existing kinds. This aligns with Haspelmath's insistence that cross-linguistic and cross-community categories are defined by purpose.
- When discussing "native speaker," make explicit whether you are using a descriptive category (within a community) or a comparative concept (across communities). The latter requires a substantive definition, not a folk term.
- Use Haspelmath to justify why "language" should not be the basic unit in a theory of grammar: it is a socially labeled system, not a universal natural kind.
