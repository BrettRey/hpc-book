# Bach 2016 - Social categories are natural kinds, not objective types (notes for Ch15)

## Core claim
- Theodore Bach argues that social categories (e.g., gender, race) are better understood as natural kinds with historical essences rather than as "objective types." Objective types look politically attractive because they are real without being essentialist, but they are empirically and politically unstable.
- Objective types: similarity classes defined by any objective property (including relational properties). They are real and causally relevant, but their unity does not come from an essence.
- Bach's thesis: Objective type classification often fixes extensions by stipulation and blocks empirical discovery. A natural kind view with historical essences better supports political aims and scientific inquiry.

## The "engineering problem" in social ontology
- Social ontologists want categories to be real (for political representation and causal explanation) while avoiding essentialism.
- Objective types appear to solve this: they are real, mind-independent, and non-essentialist.
- Bach argues this is a "Trojan horse": objective types deliver stability by stipulation, not by empirically grounded clustering, and thus do not support the kinds of revision and discovery social inquiry needs.

## Why objective types fail (as Bach frames it)
- Objective types are defined by a chosen similarity dimension. Once set, the extension is fixed by that dimension.
- This blocks the possibility that we can learn new things about the kind that change our understanding of its boundaries.
- It also fragments scientific inquiry: different research programs that track different properties of the same social kind end up referring to different objective types, undermining synthesis.
- Political cost: if we fix the extension of "women" or "men" to a chosen objective property (e.g., subordination or privilege), then counterexamples become "not really" members, which can erase lived realities and block revision.

## Why historical-essence natural kinds are better (for his purposes)
- On a historical kind view, kinds are unified by shared historical lineage or common causal history.
- This allows discovery and revision: we can find that the kind has properties not originally central, and still treat it as the same kind because the historical basis remains.
- It supports cross-program integration: different empirical programs can study different properties of the same kind and contribute to a single, evolving picture.
- Political payoff: you can keep categories real and revisable without treating them as fixed objective types or as essentialist.

## Key distinctions useful for Ch15
- Objective type: any objectively unified similarity class. Its unity is stipulated by the chosen property, so it resists revision.
- Natural kind with historical essence: unity is grounded in shared history or lineage. It is real but open to empirical discovery.
- Empirical adequacy vs political adequacy: a category that is politically attractive but empirically brittle can backfire, because political work depends on reliable empirical tracking.

## How this connects to communicative situations and "native speaker"
- A "native speaker" category construed as an objective type (e.g., a cluster of standard-like competencies) will be brittle and politically fraught. It will exclude actual speakers who don't meet the stipulated criterion.
- A historical kind framing would treat "native speaker" as a socially and historically produced kind (if we want to keep it at all), allowing that its properties can shift with social history, education systems, and ideology.
- For dialect/register/discourse community: the categories are better understood as historically grounded social kinds (lineage + transmission) rather than as objective types anchored to single properties (geography, class, or register).

## Implications for HPC framing
- Bach's preference for historical essences maps well onto HPC: kinds can be real without having strict necessary and sufficient conditions, because their unity is produced by causal histories.
- This supports Ch15's argument that communicative situations and social stabilization mechanisms (transmission, alignment, institutional norms) are what ground social categories.
- It also supports a critical stance toward any category treated as fixed solely by a chosen diagnostic (objective type logic).

## Concrete drafting uses for Ch15
- Use Bach to justify moving away from static, stipulative definitions of "native speaker" or "standard" categories.
- Use Bach to argue that social categories (dialect, register, discourse community) should be individuated by mechanisms and history, not by a single external criterion (e.g., place of birth or educational background).
- Use Bach to emphasize why social-ontological categories need to be empirically adequate if they are to serve political or methodological aims.

## Quick argument skeleton (LLM-ready)
- Premise: Objective types fix categories by a chosen property; this looks anti-essentialist but actually blocks discovery.
- Premise: Social categories need to support revision and cross-program integration.
- Conclusion: Treat them as natural kinds with historical essences (or HPC-like kinds) rather than objective types.
- Application: "Native speaker" and "dialect" should be treated as historically grounded social kinds, not as objective types defined by a single measure of competence or geography.

## Cautions for drafting
- Bach is not denying the reality of social categories; he is arguing against a particular ontological tool (objective types) for them.
- The "historical essence" notion is meant to be non-essentialist in the traditional sense; it is a lineage/trajectory account, not a fixed intrinsic property account.
- Emphasize the methodological and political motivations: categories must be empirically adequate to be politically useful.
