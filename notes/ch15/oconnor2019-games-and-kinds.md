# O'Connor 2019 - Games and kinds (notes for Ch15)

## Core question
- Do linguistic terms evolve to track property clusters (as cluster-kind/HPC theorists suggest)?
- O'Connor uses evolutionary game theory (sim-max games) to test this and shows two failure modes: conventionality and functionality.

## Key claims
- Even when property clusters exist, evolved terms may be conventional: different stable partitions can emerge that do not map cleanly to the "natural" clusters.
- More importantly, when successful action depends on payoff structure rather than property structure, terms will track payoff-relevant distinctions, not property clusters.
- Therefore, the link between property clusters and inductive success is not automatic. It depends on whether the relevant properties matter for payoffs.

## Model sketch (sim-max)
- Agents interact in a similarity-maximizing game: communication succeeds if they coordinate on categories that make action successful.
- In worlds with clustering, terms often align with clusters, but not uniquely. Conventional partitions can still stabilize.
- If payoff-relevant dimensions cut across the clusters, evolved categories follow payoff space rather than property space.

## Philosophical upshot
- Cluster-kind realists cannot simply assume that property clusters yield stable, natural terms.
- A possible rescue is promiscuous realism: kinds are natural relative to particular payoff-relevant properties or purposes.
- This aligns with a field-relative view of naturalness: what is "natural" depends on the project and the payoff structure.

## Relevance to Ch15
- Communicative situations are payoff structures. Dialect/register choices evolve to solve social coordination problems, not to mirror intrinsic clusters.
- This helps explain why sociolinguistic categories are often messy: they are shaped by payoff relevance (identity, prestige, alignment) rather than by structural clustering alone.
- Supports the argument that language categories are purpose- and situation-relative (field-relative projectibility in book terms).

## HPC integration
- Reinforces the need to treat HPC kinds as purpose-relative: if mechanisms stabilize patterns because of payoffs, then projectibility is indexed to those payoffs.
- Suggests that categories like dialect/register/discourse community will be natural only relative to certain social purposes.

## Drafting hooks
- "Terms track payoff space, not property space."  
- "Cluster structure is not enough; payoff relevance decides which partitions stabilize."  
- "Naturalness is purpose-relative: promiscuous realism is not a bug but a consequence of function."  

## Suggested placement in Ch15
- Use in the theoretical framing of communicative situations: they define payoff space, which shapes which categories stabilize.
- Use in the method section to justify why sociolinguistic categories are purpose-relative and why multiple overlapping kinds can coexist.

## Cautions
- O'Connor does not deny that clusters matter; she argues they are not decisive without payoff relevance.
- Avoid presenting her as anti-realism; her conclusion is compatible with a pluralist realism about kinds.


## Additional details
- The sim-max game models agents who need to coordinate on categories to achieve success; the game favors partitions of property space that maximize similarity within categories.
- In many model runs, terms align with convex regions of property space, but which convex partition stabilizes can be path-dependent and conventional.
- When payoffs depend on a different structure than the property clustering (e.g., ecological or social relevance), terms evolve to track that payoff structure, not the original clusters.
- O'Connor uses this to warn against the assumption that clustering automatically yields inductive success. The link is mediated by what counts as success in a community.

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- Communicative situations define payoff structures. This helps explain why dialect/register partitions are often tuned to social goals (solidarity, authority, politeness) rather than to purely structural clusters.
- Field-relative projectibility in the book can be grounded here: a category is "natural" relative to the payoff structure of a field or community.
- Suggests a mechanism for why multiple overlapping sociolinguistic categories coexist: different payoff spaces yield different stabilized partitions.


## Further points to mine
- O'Connor explicitly discusses "Voronoi languages": partitions of property space that are optimal given a distance metric. This provides a clean mathematical picture of why convex categories are attractive but not inevitable.
- She highlights cases where perceptual categories themselves are conventional. Even before words attach, the perceptual space can be partitioned in multiple stable ways.
- The upshot is a two-stage conventionality: perceptual partitioning can be conventional, and lexicalization on top can be conventional as well.

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- For dialect/register: even if there is a structural cluster (phonology, morphosyntax), social payoff space can make different partitions salient (e.g., group identity vs intelligibility). This explains why "dialect boundaries" are fuzzy.
- For "native speaker": the category is unlikely to align with a single property cluster because the payoff space (gatekeeping, schooling, prestige) often dominates the property space.
