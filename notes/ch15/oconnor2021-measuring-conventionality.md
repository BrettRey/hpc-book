# O'Connor 2021 - Measuring conventionality (notes for Ch15)

## Core thesis
- Conventionality is not all-or-nothing. Conventions come in degrees of arbitrariness.
- O'Connor proposes an information-theoretic measure of how "surprising" or underdetermined a conventional outcome is, given the space of possible equilibria.

## Key ideas
- Standard accounts (Lewis) treat conventions as binary. But many conventions could have been otherwise only in limited ways.
- Example: driving side (two options) vs word meaning (many options). Both are conventions, but arbitrariness differs.
- Degree of arbitrariness is captured by unpredictability of the outcome in a cultural evolutionary process.

## Proposed framework
- Use game-theoretic models to represent coordination problems.
- Use information theory (surprisal / entropy-like measures) to quantify how many outcomes are plausible and how constrained the process is.
- Conventions are more arbitrary when the outcome is less predictable.
- Measure is representation-dependent; choice of representation should follow explanatory aims.

## Applications in the paper
- Gendered division of labor: how much is functionally constrained vs historically contingent.
- Indirect requests: conventional but also functional (politeness, coordination).
- Word order: constrained by information structure but still partly arbitrary.
- Color categories: debates about perception vs communication can be reframed as degrees of conventionality.

## Relevance to Ch15
- Gives a way to talk about degrees of conventionality in dialects, registers, and discourse community norms.
- Supports a nuanced account of "native speaker" norms: some norms are highly constrained (low arbitrariness), others are highly conventional (high arbitrariness).
- Provides a bridge between functional explanations (why a pattern is useful) and historical contingency (why it is this pattern rather than another).

## HPC integration
- HPC kinds often involve both functional constraints and arbitrary stabilizations. This framework gives a way to talk about that mixture.
- Helps avoid false dichotomies: a category can be real and functional while still arbitrary in several dimensions.

## Drafting hooks
- "Conventions vary in arbitrariness; some are tightly constrained, others could have been many ways."  
- "Functional does not mean inevitable; arbitrary does not mean useless."  
- "Measuring conventionality is measuring how constrained the equilibrium is."  

## Suggested placement in Ch15
- Use in the register/dialect section to explain why some sociolinguistic norms are stable yet historically contingent.
- Use in the methodological section to justify mixed explanations: partial functional constraint plus historical accident.

## Cautions
- The measure is representation-dependent. Emphasize that the choice of model is part of the explanation.
- Do not overclaim that the measure is a direct empirical metric; it is a conceptual tool linked to modeling.


## Additional details
- The measure is designed to capture how many alternative equilibria were plausible given the coordination problem. More possible equilibria -> higher conventionality.
- Representation dependence is framed as a feature, not a bug: the modeler must choose the representation that matches explanatory aims.
- The framework breaks a common dichotomy: explanations should not choose between "functional" and "arbitrary"; many traits are both to differing degrees.

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- Dialect features can be modeled as conventions with different degrees of arbitrariness (e.g., some phonological shifts are highly constrained by articulation, others are nearly arbitrary).
- Register conventions (e.g., formal pronouns, politeness routines) can be described as low-arbitrariness outcomes if they solve stable coordination problems; others (specific formulae) are high-arbitrariness.
- The framework offers a way to argue that "native speaker" norms are partly conventional and partly functionally constrained, which weakens essentialist readings.


## Further points to mine
- Lewis-style conventions require common knowledge, but O'Connor emphasizes that evolutionary accounts can relax these conditions while still capturing stable coordination.
- The measure can also be used to frame debates about innateness vs culture: if a pattern has low arbitrariness given human constraints, it is less informative to ascribe it to convention alone.
- She stresses that functional explanations and conventional explanations are complementary, not competing. This is a useful rhetorical stance for Ch15.

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- When discussing register norms, use this framework to argue that some conventions are tightly constrained (e.g., turn-taking repair strategies) while others are highly arbitrary (choice of particular discourse markers).
- For dialect, argue that some features are low-arbitrariness outcomes of articulatory/perceptual constraints, while others are high-arbitrariness path-dependent conventions.
