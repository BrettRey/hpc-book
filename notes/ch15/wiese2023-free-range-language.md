# Wiese 2023 - Grammatical systems without language borders (notes for Ch15)

## Scope and thesis
- Book-length argument that grammatical systems do not need language borders. The basic unit of organization is the communicative situation ("com-sit"), not a named language.
- "Free-range" language settings (less constrained by monolingual/standard ideologies) make this visible. They show grammar emerging from situationally organized repertoires, with named languages functioning as optional social indices rather than the basis of grammar.
- The theoretical payoff: grammar is grounded in communicative situations; language labels are sociolinguistic overlays that index belonging, formality, identity, and stance.

## Core construct: communicative situation (com-sit)
- Definition: a com-sit is the setting of communication as perceived by speakers. It is not a fixed list of features; it is a dynamic, socially interpreted bundle of situational characteristics (participants, activity type, medium, goals, stance, etc.).
- Com-sits are defined by speaker perceptions of what is relevant. This makes them open-ended and empirically discoverable rather than stipulated.
- Key move: com-sits are primary. Language categories emerge from com-sit distribution; com-sits do not derive from pre-existing language borders.
- Com-sits can be encoded as part of lexical/constructional representations. Wiese suggests com-sit features can live alongside phonology, syntax, semantics (compatible with Construction Grammar, HPSG, etc.).

## Com-sits and registers
- Registers are the linguistic side of com-sit differences. Com-sits are the situational side; registers are what the com-sit does to linguistic choice probabilities.
- Register distinctions thus become the linguistic reflection of situational conditioning. The list of com-sit features is not closed; the relevant ones are those that actually track systematic shifts in usage.
- Implication: register is not a separate system. It is a conditional reweighting of options in a shared repertoire.

## Three headline lessons (explicit in conclusion)
1. Com-sits support linguistic differentiation.
   - Speakers organize repertoires by com-sit. This is learned early in acquisition and visible in variation.
   - New varieties can arise when a cluster of com-sits becomes specialized (example: urban youth varieties).
2. Grammar is grounded in com-sits.
   - Co-occurrence of elements within com-sits strengthens connections (selective reinforcement). This moves an unstructured "feature pool" toward a more structured "feature pond" (ecology of patterns).
   - Com-sit anchoring allows grammar-like regularities without language borders.
3. "Languages" index belonging.
   - Named languages are optional sociolinguistic indices tied to specific macro-ideological contexts (monoglossic/standard ideologies).
   - Language labels become tools for identity signaling, formality management, inclusion/exclusion. This is socially real but not grammatically necessary.

## Empirical settings used as "free-range" windows
- Urban markets: high diversity, strong mixing. Demonstrates translinguistic constructions and emergent local norms.
- Heritage language settings: family-based bilingualism; com-sit distinctions tied to interlocutors and activities.
- Multiethnic adolescent peer groups: urban contact dialects (e.g., Kiezdeutsch) emerge in tightly defined com-sits and can expand as their com-sit base widens.
- Digital social media: written but informal. Emoji and graphic markers behave as translinguistic discourse markers; com-sit shifts can spread across modalities.

## Acquisition and learning evidence
- Children learn com-sit differentiation early. They track who-when-where to align forms with settings (communicative competence).
- Example of a child using a "Daddy register" (German with father), then later broadening to a conventional com-sit definition (German in wider contexts). The idiosyncratic stage highlights that com-sit identification is a learned hypothesis, not a fixed property.
- These cases support the claim that com-sit distributions are learned and can drive the emergence of more systematic grammar-like patterns.

## Mechanism sketch (implicit HPC fit)
- Repeated co-occurrence in specific com-sits strengthens links among forms (entrenchment + alignment).
- Com-sits serve as environmental niches; societal macro contexts (monoglossic ideologies, standardization) act as higher-level pressures shaping which com-sits are viable and how they index identity.
- Language indices, once established, can feed back: items labeled as "German" or "English" get used in com-sits that demand those indices (formality, group identity). But this is secondary.

## How this helps Ch15
- Provides the theoretical backbone for a chapter centered on communicative situations. It legitimizes treating com-sits as the unit of stabilization for grammar and social varieties.
- Gives a principled link between register, dialect, and discourse community: all are ways of slicing com-sit distributions, not separate grammars.
- Supplies a strong claim about "native speaker": language labels are sociolinguistic indices, not the source of grammar. This supports a move away from native-speaker essentialism.
- Offers an explanatory pathway for variation: com-sit conditioning creates stable clusters without hard borders, matching HPC expectations (mechanism-driven stability + local indeterminacy).

## Drafting hooks / phrasing ideas
- "Grammar does not live inside languages; it lives inside communicative situations." (Use to reframe the chapter.)
- "Registers are the linguistic face of com-sits." (Connect register to conditioning structure.)
- "Language labels are social indices layered onto com-sit-based systems." (For the "native speaker" and normativity discussion.)
- "Free-range settings make the mechanisms visible." (For a transition from theory to cases.)

## Cautions for drafting
- Wiese does not deny the reality of languages; she recasts them as sociolinguistic indices. Avoid straw-manning as "languages are unreal". The claim is about their role in grammar.
- Com-sits are open-ended: do not treat them as a closed list of features. Emphasize empirical identification and speaker perception.
- This is not a rejection of variation as structured; it is a different structure (com-sit-based).
