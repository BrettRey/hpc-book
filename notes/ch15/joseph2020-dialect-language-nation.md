# Joseph, Rutten, Vosters 2020 - Dialect, language, nation: 50 years on (notes for Ch15)

## What the paper is
- Review article marking 50 years since Haugen’s (1966) “Dialect, language, nation.”
- Reassesses Haugen’s four-step standardization model: **selection, codification, acceptance, elaboration**.
- Adds intellectual history of Haugen’s life/work, then surveys expansions (Milroy & Milroy 1985; Joseph 1987), and identifies lacunae in the model: ideology, directionality, monolingual bias, language contact, and narrow empirical scope.

## Haugen’s four-step model (core summary)
- **Selection**: choose a dialect/variety to serve as basis of the standard.
- **Codification**: develop formal norms (grammar, orthography, lexicon).
- **Acceptance**: community adoption; must be implemented, not just declared.
- **Elaboration**: expand functional range so the standard can serve all domains.
- Haugen separates form-focused steps (selection, codification) and function-focused steps (acceptance, elaboration).

## Haugen’s intellectual context (important framing)
- Haugen’s work was pivotal in shifting linguistics from pure system-description toward sociolinguistic reality: variation, social evaluation, and standardization.
- His experience with Norwegian language politics (Bokmål vs Nynorsk) shaped his model.
- His model is historically grounded (postmedieval Europe), but widely applied across contexts.

## Major expansions and revisions discussed
### Milroy & Milroy (1985)
- Emphasis on **uniformity** (minimal variation in form) as the aim of standardization.
- Standardization is **ideology and policing**, not neutral planning.
- Highlights intolerance to variation, prescriptive enforcement, and the social role of institutions.

### Joseph (1987)
- Adds distinction between **engineered** vs **circumstantial** standardization:
  - Engineered: deliberate, top‑down advocacy by standardizers (selection → codification → implementation).
  - Circumstantial: standard-like norms emerge without explicit planning (e.g., convergence/koineization).
- Adds **maintenance** as a crucial step: keeping the standard in a privileged position through institutions and education.
- Emphasizes **implementation** (propagation) as active, not passive acceptance.

## Critiques / lacunae in Haugen’s framework (key for Ch15)
1. **Directionality bias (top‑down assumption)**
   - Haugen assumes elite-driven standardization. But historical sociolinguistics shows bottom‑up processes: convergence, koineization, urban mobility, media, printing.
   - Standardization can arise from contact and accommodation, not only planning.

2. **Ideology is underplayed**
   - Standardization is not just technical; it is ideological.
   - Standard language ideology (Lippi‑Green; Blommaert & Verschueren) shapes which varieties count as “correct.”
   - Haugen’s own model embeds ideology (assumptions about equality, nation-building).

3. **Monolingual bias / lack of language contact**
   - Haugen’s model is largely monolingual; multilingual contexts are marginal.
   - Standardization studies need to address bilingualism, contact, and translanguaging settings.
   - Comparative standardology should integrate language contact as a core factor.

4. **Narrow empirical scope**
   - Traditional focus on written, formal texts and elite norms ignores handwritten and everyday forms.
   - Need attention to *implementation* and *acceptance* empirically (how standards spread, who adopts them).
   - Also need study of **failed standardizations** and **de‑selection** (variants rejected, erased, stigmatized).

## Refinements within each step
- **Selection** is not just macro choice of a dialect; there are micro choices of variants, and even *meso‑selection* of feature bundles.
- **Codification** is not necessarily explicit; there can be **implicit codification** through supraregionalization and standard-like diffusion.
- **Acceptance/implementation** must be measured empirically; formal acceptance can mask weak uptake.
- **Elaboration** interacts with maintenance and ideology; functional expansion alone does not guarantee standard status.

## Relevance to Ch15 (communicative situations, dialects, registers, native speaker)
- Provides a modernized standardization model with ideology and contact at the center — crucial for a chapter on communicative situations and social stabilization.
- Supports the idea that standards are historical and ideological, not just structural.
- Highlights that “standard language” is often a product of *implementation* and *maintenance* institutions, not just internal linguistic properties.
- The monolingual bias critique aligns with Wiese’s "free‑range" argument: language borders are social overlays, not grammatical foundations.
- The engineered vs circumstantial distinction gives a mechanism for how registers/dialects can become standardized without explicit planning.

## Drafting hooks / claims
- "Haugen’s four boxes still matter, but ideology and contact are the missing fifth and sixth boxes."  
- "Standardization is not just selection and codification; it is maintenance, implementation, and ideological enforcement."  
- "Not all standards are engineered; some are emergent products of mobility and contact."  
- "Traditional standardization studies are monolingual by default; a communicative‑situation lens corrects this bias."  

## Ch15 integration ideas
- Use to frame a section on **standard language ideology** and its role in policing “native speaker” norms.
- Use the engineered/circumstantial distinction to explain how register norms can become standard‑like without formal codification.
- Use the monolingual bias critique to justify shifting the unit of analysis to communicative situations and mixed repertoires.
- Use the selection/codification/acceptance breakdown to structure a mechanism story for how a register or dialect becomes “standard.”

## Cautions
- The article is a review; it summarizes other frameworks. Avoid attributing all critiques directly to Haugen as if he ignored them intentionally.
- Keep the historical focus clear: this model is anchored in postmedieval European standardization, not necessarily universal.
