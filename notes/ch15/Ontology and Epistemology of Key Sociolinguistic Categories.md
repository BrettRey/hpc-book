# Ontology and Epistemology of Key Sociolinguistic Categories

Ontology and Epistemology of Key Sociolinguistic
Categories
Understanding dialect, register, variant, and discourse community requires examining what each is
taken to be (ontology) and how we come to know it (epistemology) across different sociolinguistic traditions.
Below, each category is explored through multiple theoretical perspectives (Labovian variationism,
interactional sociolinguistics, indexicality and linguistic anthropology, ethnography of communication, etc.),
along with how researchers operationalize and critique these concepts. Key debates and shifts in usage
over time are also highlighted.

Dialect
Ontology (What is a dialect?): In sociolinguistics, “dialect” generally refers to a variety of a language
defined by the user (often regionally or socially). M.A.K. Halliday famously distinguished dialect as a “variety
according to the user,” in contrast to register as a “variety according to use” 1 . Traditionally, dialects are
seen as legitimate, rule-governed linguistic systems (sometimes called language varieties), none of which is
inherently superior. Early variationists like William Labov built on the premise of orderly heterogeneity – the
idea that dialect differences are systematic and structured rather than random noise 2 . By the late 1960s,
Labov and colleagues postulated that no dialect is inherently deficient; all dialects of a language are equally
complex in structure (even if they serve different functions or carry different prestige) 3 . This view
countered older “deficit” models and emphasized that dialect differences are sociocultural, not cognitive, in
origin. For example, African American Vernacular English (AAVE) was shown to be a rule-governed dialect,
discrediting the notion that it was “broken English.” In short, the ontology of “dialect” in modern
sociolinguistics is that of a bona fide linguistic system (grammar, lexicon, pronunciation) associated with a
particular community.
At the same time, sociolinguists recognize that the line between “dialect” and “language” is often political
and ideological. It is often said that “a language is a dialect with an army and a navy,” implying that the
distinction is political rather than linguistic 4 . In practice, mutual intelligibility is sometimes used as a
criterion (dialects of the same language are broadly intelligible, whereas different languages are not), but
this too fails in many cases. For instance, spoken Norwegian and Swedish are mutually intelligible
(suggesting they could be dialects of one language), yet they are treated as separate languages due to
national identity. Conversely, the Chinese “dialects” (e.g. Mandarin vs. Cantonese) are not mutually
intelligible, yet are termed dialects within a single language for political reasons. Sociolinguistic ontology
thus treats dialect boundaries as fluid and often constructed. Dialects exist on continuums, and sharp
borders are often the artifact of historical and ideological processes 4 . Critical work on language
ideologies (e.g. Irvine & Gal’s studies of how linguistic boundaries are created and “enregistered”)
underscores that naming something a dialect vs. a language involves social power and cultural perception,
not just linguistic distance. In sum, “dialect” is understood as a socially defined variety of language – real in
its structured linguistic patterns, but not a fixed or naturally bounded entity.

Epistemology (How do we know/study dialects?): The study of dialects has evolved from traditional
dialectology to quantitative variationist sociolinguistics. Early dialectologists in the 19th–20th centuries used
survey and mapping methods: they elicited words and pronunciations from non-mobile rural speakers to
create dialect atlases (e.g. identifying isoglosses—geographic boundaries of linguistic features). This
positivist approach assumed that dialects could be mapped in space by stable features. Labov’s innovation
was to bring dialect study into cities and incorporate social dimensions (urban dialectology). Variationist
methodology treats dialect differences as aggregations of sociolinguistic variables – individual linguistic
features with identifiable variants. Researchers operationalize “dialect” by sampling speakers from different
groups (regions, social classes, ethnic groups, etc.), recording their speech (often using the sociolinguistic
interview), and identifying how frequently particular variants occur. For example, Labov’s study of New York
City English quantified the dropping of /r/ (e.g. ca[r] vs. cah) across social classes to characterize the NYC
dialect 5 6 . Variationists rely on statistical tools (like VARBRUL and other regression models) to
measure the effect of social and linguistic factors on variant usage 7 8 . The principle of accountability
guides this work: all instances where a variable could occur must be counted, including each variant’s
presence or absence 9 . In Labov’s words, “any variable form (a member of a set of alternative ways of ‘saying
the same thing’) should be reported with the proportion of cases in which it did occur in the relevant environment,
compared to the total number of cases in which it might have occurred” 9 . This ensures researchers don’t
cherry-pick examples; instead, they capture the true frequency of dialect features.
In addition to frequency analysis, perceptual dialectology (asking non-linguists about dialect regions and
traits) offers epistemological insight into folk conceptions of dialect boundaries (revealing language
ideologies). Interactional sociolinguists and anthropologists might study dialect empirically by observing
code-switching or style-shifting: how speakers alternate between dialects or dialect features in
conversation as contextualization cues. For example, John J. Gumperz showed that switching dialects or
languages in dialogue can signal social meaning in interaction. Ethnographers may immerse in
communities to learn which speech forms locals regard as “our dialect” versus “others’ speech,” giving an
emic (insider) perspective on dialect boundaries. Triangulating these methods – quantitative patterning,
speaker perceptions, and interactional usage – allows sociolinguists to validate what counts as a distinct
dialect and how coherent it is.
Critical and reflexive perspectives: A significant body of scholarship questions rigid notions of dialect.
One issue is the dialect–standard dichotomy: labeling one variety (usually of the powerful group) as the
“standard language” and others as “dialects” often reflects social hierarchy rather than purely linguistic
difference. Lippi-Green (1997) and others describe a “standard language ideology” in which the standard
dialect is seen as the only proper form of the language, casting dialects as inferior or “incorrect.”
Sociolinguists push back on this, noting all dialects are equally expressive and systematic; what differs is
prestige and power, not linguistic sophistication 10 . Another critical angle is the blurred boundary
problem: in dialect continua (e.g. across a large geography), where does one dialect end and the next
begin? Researchers like Peter Trudgill emphasize that dialects often merge imperceptibly into each other
across space, so drawing discrete boundaries is somewhat arbitrary.
Moreover, contemporary approaches in linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics of globalization argue
that traditional dialect concepts assume a relatively homogeneous speech community, which may never
have truly existed and certainly is less applicable in today’s mobile, networked world. Recent work on superdiversity and translanguaging suggests that people increasingly draw on complex linguistic repertoires that
don’t neatly fit “a dialect” or “a language.” As Saraceni and Jacob (2019) summarize, many sociolinguists now
“prefer to describe language behavior as social practice where speakers make use of shared

2

linguistic repertoires in fluid and dynamic ways rather than adhering to the static rules of prepackaged and labelled languages” 11 . This perspective reveals that “dialects” (and even “languages”) are
not discrete natural objects but socially constructed categories. Nonetheless, they remain powerful
constructs – for example, a community’s sense of identity may be tied to speaking “our dialect,” and nationstates often standardize one dialect as the national language. Critical scholarship thus walks a fine line:
recognizing dialects as ideological constructs while acknowledging their real social consequences. Debates
continue over how to balance these views. Overall, the field has shifted from treating dialects as fixed sets
of features to viewing them as part of dynamic repertoires and identity practices, shaped by historical,
political, and interactional forces.

Register
Ontology (What is a register?): A register is traditionally defined as a variety of language according to use –
that is, the way one speaks or writes in a particular communicative situation or for a particular purpose 1 .
In contrast to dialect (variation by user/group), register is about situational variation: e.g. formal vs. informal,
scientific vs. casual, written vs. spoken, legal language vs. everyday conversation. Halliday’s systemic
functional linguistics provided a foundational view of registers. Halliday described a register as “a
configuration of meanings that is associated with a particular situation type”, determined by contextual
variables: field (topic or activity), tenor (social relations among participants), and mode (channel like
spoken/written) 12 . In this view, a lawyer in court, a sportscaster during a game, and friends chatting at a
bar each employ different registers (legal register, sports commentary register, colloquial conversation)
suited to those contexts. The ontology here treats registers as functional varieties of a language – often
cutting across dialects. For example, academic English is a register characterized by certain vocabulary and
syntax (passives, technical terms, etc.), and it can be used by speakers of many dialects when writing
formally.
Variationist sociolinguistics initially focused more on “style” than on register per se, but the concepts
overlap. Early sociolinguists like Martin Joos (1961) described five styles on a formality continuum (frozen,
formal, consultative, casual, intimate), essentially registers of formality. Labov’s own framework treated
style-shifting as largely driven by attention to speech (more careful speech = more formal style) 13 . In this
Labovian view, styles/registers were seen as different levels of formality of the same dialect: e.g. a speaker
might use the vernacular register (casual speech) with friends but a more standard register when reading
aloud. This is a rather one-dimensional take on register. Later perspectives, especially in linguistic
anthropology, expanded the ontology of register. Asif Agha’s work on enregisterment reconceptualizes
registers as cultural models of speech associated with social identities and values. In Agha’s terms, a register
is a set of linguistic forms or features that people recognize as indexing a particular social role or context
14 . For example, “baby talk” is a register: a constellation of features (diminutives, cooing intonation, etc.)
associated with caregiver–infant interaction. Similarly, internet slang or textspeak (LOL, brb, emoji usage) can
be considered a modern register of online communication. In this third-wave, indexicality-focused ontology,
registers are not just situational styles but also carry indexical meanings – they invoke images of types of
speakers or activities (the formality of a legal register indexes authority and seriousness; a hip-hop register
indexes urban youth culture, etc.). Thus, the notion of register bridges language and social meaning: it’s a
socially recognized way of speaking that is enregistered in the community’s consciousness 15 .
Epistemology (How to identify and study registers?): Different approaches yield different methodologies
for registers. Systemic linguists and discourse analysts often use corpus-based analysis: they gather
large text corpora from different contexts and quantitatively compare their linguistic features. Douglas

3

Biber’s multidimensional analysis (1988) is a classic example: Biber analyzed dozens of linguistic features
(e.g. pronoun rates, noun complexity, tense usage) across genres like conversations, academic writing,
news, fiction, etc. Using factor analysis, he identified underlying dimensions (such as “involved vs.
informational production”) that distinguish registers 16 17 . For instance, conversation tends to have more
pronouns and questions (an involved, interactive register), whereas academic prose has more nouns and
long words (an informational register). This quantitative approach operationalizes register as a cluster of cooccurring features characteristic of a situational category. It provides a way to measure register differences
and even to classify texts by register based on their linguistic profiles.
Ethnography and qualitative discourse analysis provide another lens. An ethnography of communication
(Hymes) might investigate how community members distinguish speech appropriate for a wedding versus a
market versus a classroom. Researchers could observe and record events in each context, noting the
linguistic choices and norms (levels of formality, jargon, etc.). They might interview insiders about their
perceptions (“How do people speak at a funeral as opposed to a party?”) to uncover the community’s own
register categories. Conversation analysts sometimes examine how participants shift registers within
interaction – for example, an official might suddenly switch to a ceremonial register mid-conversation as a
contextualization cue that something formal is happening. Gumperz’s interactional sociolinguistics
documents such code and style shifts as signals of footing (e.g. an employee dropping into a very formal
register to indicate deference or to quote someone official).
In variationist practice, style-shifting experiments can be used as a proxy for register change. Labov’s
interviews elicited different styles by shifting tasks (casual chat, formal interview questions, reading
passages, word lists) 13 . This method assumes that as attention or formality increases, the speaker moves
from an informal register toward a more formal/standard register. The analyst then measures linguistic
variables across these contexts to see how much style/register shifting occurs. While somewhat
mechanistic, this provides evidence of a style range for each speaker and community. More targeted studies
focus on specific registers: e.g. Charles Ferguson’s classic papers on “baby talk,” “foreigner talk,” and “sports
announcer talk” gathered data in those situations to describe their distinctive linguistic properties (like the
present-tense, play-by-play syntax of sports commentary) 18 . In all cases, the validity of a register category
is bolstered if one finds a constellation of features systematically co-occurring in that context and if
speakers themselves recognize that way of speaking. Modern sociolinguists often combine approaches: e.g.
analyzing online discussion forums (corpus analysis) while also examining meta-comments and memes
about “internet speak” (which reflect folk awareness of that register).
Critical and reflexive perspectives: Scholarship has problematized the concept of register on several
fronts. One issue is that the boundaries between registers can be fuzzy. Unlike dialects (often tied to
relatively distinct speaker groups or regions), registers form a continuous spectrum of situational variation.
Where does “casual” end and “formal” begin? Rather than discrete registers, speakers command a
repertoire of styles that they maneuver fluidly. The third-wave emphasis on style (Eckert, Coupland)
reframes what earlier scholars might call registers as dynamic stylistic resources deployed creatively, rather
than fixed sets of forms. For example, an individual might blend elements of a youth slang register with a
workplace-professional register in a single interaction to achieve a particular effect – something not easily
captured if we treat registers as sealed boxes. This has led researchers to emphasize speaker agency and
hybridity in language use: speakers can cross or mix registers for stylistic performance (see e.g. Ben
Rampton’s work on language crossing, where adolescents adopt out-group styles like “cool” Jamaican Creole
phrases in British schools to index identity).

4

Another line of critique concerns ideology and power in registers. Calling something a “register” can
sometimes downplay its status compared to a “dialect” or “language.” For instance, what one person calls
“legal register” might be termed “Legal English” by someone else – the latter perhaps granting it more
autonomy and prestige. Critical discourse analysts note that prestigious registers (academic, legal,
scientific) are often gatekept by institutions, thereby excluding those not fluent in them. There is thus an
ideological component: society valorizes certain registers as markers of education or authority (e.g. being
able to “talk like a lawyer” in court), which ties into issues of access and identity. Work by Bourdieu on
linguistic capital resonates here – mastery of a valued register yields power in particular fields. Some
scholars also highlight how registers can carry stereotypes: e.g. the “Valley Girl” register (stereotyped by
uptalk, “like” insertion, etc.) indexes a persona in popular culture, often demeaned as frivolous; describing
that way of speaking as a register acknowledges it as a socially recognizable style, but also invites analysis
of how it’s ideologically caricatured.
Finally, the notion of enregisterment (Agha) is itself a reflexive, critical concept: it examines how a set of
linguistic forms gets perceived as a register in the first place. Enregisterment studies show that through
media, metalinguistic commentary, and performance, societies lump certain features together and imbue
them with social meaning. For example, the features associated with “Multicultural London English (MLE)” –
youth slang, ethnically mixed accents – have been widely debated in Britain, effectively enregistering MLE
as a new urban vernacular register with social meanings (often racialized or moralized in the media). In a
study of Londoners’ perceptions, Gerwin (2022) found that speakers conceptualize “Cockney” vs. “MLE” as
distinct ways of speaking, attaching social values to each; interestingly, everyday Londoners viewed these
registers as part of a continuum in their repertoire, contrary to media portrayals of them as oppositional
19 . Such findings underscore that registers are not neutral linguistic categories – they are bound up with
social identities, stereotypes, and change over time. As society and technology evolve, new registers (e.g.
social media communication) emerge and others fall out of use, prompting ongoing re-evaluation of how
we define and delimit “a register.”

Variant (Linguistic Variable)
Ontology (What is a variant/variable?): In variationist sociolinguistics, a linguistic variable is an abstract
unit of variation – essentially, “a set of alternative ways of saying the same thing” (to quote Labov’s famous
definition). Each realization of that variable is a variant. For example, the variable (ING) in English has two
common phonetic variants: -ing [ɪŋ] as in “running” vs. -in [ɪn] as in “runnin’.” Crucially, these variants are
understood to have the same referential meaning (they refer to the same action of running) 20 . This
principle – that variants are functionally equivalent – is part of the ontology of the sociolinguistic variable. It
means that variation is viewed as non-denotational: differences in pronunciation, form, or syntax that do not
change truth-conditional meaning. This concept allowed Labov and others to treat variability systematically:
if two forms mean the same in truth-conditional terms, any difference in their use can be attributed to
social or internal linguistic factors rather than semantic necessity. The linguistic variable concept thus
bridges linguistic structure and social usage, embedding heterogeneity within the language system itself.
Ontologically, early variationists saw the variable as an element of grammar that could have probabilistic
rules. Labov introduced the idea of variable rules – grammatical rules that apply some percentage of the
time – to integrate variation into linguistic theory 9 . This was a break from the classical structuralist view
(and Chomskyan ideal) of language as a perfectly uniform competence. Labov argued that orderly
heterogeneity is part of the linguistic system; in other words, variability is inherent to language structure, not
just performance noise 21 . Not all linguists agreed – some philosophically treat “the variable” as an

5

analytical construct rather than a mental reality. But variationists tend to assume that native speakers
command multiple variants and have an internal sense (perhaps not conscious) of their social distribution. In
cognitive terms, one might ask: is a variable like (ING) stored as a single abstract unit with two phonetic
realizations, or are the two forms stored separately with sociostylistic tags? Different models exist, but the
common ontological stance is that “same meaning, different forms” constitutes a sociolinguistic variable.
Beyond phonology, variables can be lexical (word choice variants), morphosyntactic (e.g. I didn’t do anything
vs. I didn’t do nothing in some dialects), or discourse-level (choice of pragmatic particles, etc.). As variation
studies expanded, the definition of “same meaning” sometimes stretched. For instance, quotative verbs in
English (say vs. be like vs. go) have slightly different connotations, yet researchers study them as variants of
the quotative function. This led to debates like “Where does the sociolinguistic variable stop?”
(Lavandera 1978): if variants carry subtle discourse meanings, are they truly the “same thing”? Third-wave
sociolinguists, influenced by indexicality theory, reconceptualized variants not as neutral equivalents, but as
signs that carry social meaning. Penelope Eckert argues that variants come to have “indexical fields” – a
range of associated social meanings (personae, stances) that speakers can exploit. For example, dropping
the final g (runnin’) might index informality, working-class demeanor, or regional identity; these are part of
its indexical field. Ontologically, this moves away from treating the variable as a purely referential slot,
instead seeing each variant as imbued with socio-symbolic content (even if denotational content is the
same). Thus, in third-wave practice, the “linguistic variable” is sometimes deemphasized in favor of
analyzing stylistic practices – how variants work together to create an overall style. Still, the concept
remains a cornerstone of variationism as a way to systematically link micro-level form variation to macrolevel social patterns.
Epistemology (How do we study and know variables?): The core methodology was established by Labov
and has remained standard (with refinements). Researchers first identify a variable by determining a set of
forms with the same referential function. They carefully define the envelope of variation – the contexts in
which those variants can occur. For example, in studying (ING), one must decide which words or syllables
count (typically all gerunds and present participles, excluding things like “thing” where -ing is not a
morpheme choice). Once defined, one collects a large number of tokens from speech (through recordings
of various styles, interviews, natural conversations, etc.). The Principle of Accountability demands
counting all instances, not just those where the variant occurs 9 . By comparing the number of times each
variant appears against the total opportunities, one computes variant rates (e.g. speaker X said -in 30% of
the time). Then comes quantitative analysis: the heart of variationist epistemology. Using statistical tools
(formerly VARBRUL, now often mixed-effects logistic regression), analysts assess which factors correlate
with variant choice 7 22 . Factors can be internal (linguistic context, e.g. following sound, word frequency,
grammatical category) or external (social, e.g. speaker’s age, gender, class, ethnicity, style level). For
instance, a study might find that younger speakers, or men, or informal contexts favor the -in variant, while
older or more formal contexts favor -ing. Such patterns are often summarized by factor weights or
probabilities indicating the magnitude of effect 23 6 .
A classic example is Labov’s Martha’s Vineyard study: he examined the (ay) and (aw) vowels (as in rice, house)
and showed that variants (raising these diphthongs) were correlated with speakers’ orientation to the island
(locals who identified strongly with Martha’s Vineyard community used the raised variant more) – an early
finding that social attitude can correlate with variant frequency. This quantitative correlation approach
yields empirical evidence for the social meaning of variation. The use of large samples and statistical
significance testing helps ensure that observed patterns are not just anecdotal but reflect communitywide norms. Repeated studies in different communities (e.g. dozens of studies of (ING) in English

6

worldwide) provide a cumulative picture of how a variable behaves socially. Such replication has revealed
both universal tendencies (e.g. -in is informal everywhere English is spoken 20 ) and community-specific
quirks (some places might attach particular local meaning to a variant).
Beyond counting and correlations, researchers increasingly use perceptual experiments to probe what
variants mean to listeners. For example, sociophonetic studies play recordings differing only in one variable
(say, walking vs walkin’) and ask listeners to rate the speaker on traits (educated? friendly? etc.). These help
capture the social perception of variants, complementing production data. Another epistemological
approach is ethnographic observation: watching how speakers themselves talk about language. Do they
notice the variable? Do they have a name for a person who “talks proper” vs “drops their g’s”? Such metalinguistic commentary can indicate that a feature has risen to the level of social awareness (what Labov
called indicators vs. markers vs. stereotypes of variation). If a variant becomes a conscious stereotype (e.g.
the Cockney “’[h]-dropping” in words like ’ouse for house), its sociolinguistic life changes – speakers might
avoid it in careful speech or use it jokingly to index a persona. Thus, the epistemology of studying variables
spans quantitative measurement, experimentation, and qualitative insight into speaker awareness.
Critical and reflexive perspectives: The concept of the sociolinguistic variable has not gone unchallenged.
Early on, scholars like Lavandera (1978) and Romaine (1984) questioned the “same meaning” assumption,
pointing out that many so-called variables involve forms that may carry pragmatic or stylistic nuances. For
example, double negatives (I don’t want none) versus standard negatives (I don’t want any) convey the same
propositional content but might not be pragmatically identical (the former could add emphasis or a
colloquial tone). Treating them as mere variants risks overlooking how linguistic form and meaning
intertwine. Variationists responded by being cautious: variables are defined in as strictly semantic a way as
possible, and differences that do affect meaning are either excluded or analyzed separately. Still, this
remains a gray area. The rise of discourse analysis and pragmatics forced variationism to consider that no
two utterances are ever truly identical in meaning once context is considered. The field answered by moving
toward examining social meaning directly: rather than bracketing it out, third-wave studies embrace it.
Eckert and others demonstrate that speakers use variables to create meanings (stance, persona) in real time
24
25 . For instance, a teen might increase use of an incoming variant to project a “cool” identity – here the
variant is not just reflecting a social category (e.g. class) but actively constructing a persona. This
perspective complicates the variable concept: the “same thing” that variants supposedly say may include
social messaging. Consequently, some have argued the field should move beyond the variable-centric view
to a more holistic analysis of stylistic semiosis. Nonetheless, even third-wave work often still identifies
specific features/variants as carriers of indexical meaning, so the variable remains implicit as an analytic
unit (just with an expanded notion of “meaning”).
Another critique involves the homogeneity assumption in early quantitative work – the idea that
community patterns reflect individual patterns. Analysts often pooled data from many speakers and treated
that as the community grammar, which raised the question: do individuals have the same internal variable
system? Later work (e.g. Guy 1980, Sankoff & Labov) showed that individuals generally do align with group
constraints, but with some variation in rates 26 27 . More recent sociolinguistics examines intra-speaker
variation in detail: how much does one person shift variants by context or across their lifespan? This
introduces an epistemological tension: the original goal was to find community-wide stable patterns (for
instance, that a certain percentage of final /t,d/ deletion is rule-governed in a dialect). But as attention turns
to stylistic flexibility and life-stage changes, the focus shifts to individual trajectories and the fluidity of
variables, which is less amenable to neat aggregate rules. This ties into the broader post-structuralist
critique that the notion of a fixed “speech community” with a fixed set of variables and norms is

7

oversimplified (Bucholtz, 2003). People participate in multiple communities of practice, and their speech
may not conform to one uniform set of constraints.
In response, many variationists now incorporate social theory and ethnography more, merging the
quantitative rigor with qualitative context. The variable remains a useful tool, but it is now often
contextualized within speaker agency (“Why did this speaker use the nonstandard variant in this
interaction – what identity were they projecting?”) and ideology (“What ideologies lead listeners to hear that
variant as ‘sloppy’ or ‘authentic’?”). The field has also expanded the scope of what counts as a variable.
Features like intonation, discourse markers (you know, like), code-switching itself, etc., are studied with
variationist methods, albeit with care to account for their functional differences. This expansion sometimes
blurs the variable concept (can we really quantify “contextual code choice” as variants of a variable?), but it
reflects an attempt to handle the full complexity of sociolinguistic behavior.
In sum, the debates and shifts around the sociolinguistic variant mirror a journey from a structuralistleaning, form-focused paradigm to one that embraces social meaning and heterogeneity. The ontological
assumption that variables are real components of linguistic competence has been both challenged and
enriched by perspectives highlighting the social and ideological dimensions of those “alternative ways of
saying the same thing.”

Discourse Community
Ontology (What is a discourse community?): The term discourse community describes a group of
people who share ways of communicating, common goals, and particular genres or terminologies. This
concept, articulated by John Swales (1990), was developed in contrast to the more general speech
community of sociolinguistics. A traditional speech community (in Labov’s sense) is defined by shared
linguistic norms – for example, Labov defined it as a community that shares norms for evaluating language,
even if they show internal variation. Gumperz offered a complementary definition: any human aggregate
characterized by regular communication and a shared verbal repertoire and norms. These speech
community notions focus on language usage patterns and norms as a whole. In the 1980s, Swales
introduced discourse community to address groups specifically united by communicative practices and goals,
often in professional or academic domains. He outlined six defining characteristics of a discourse
community 28 :
1. Shared Goals: The community has a broadly agreed set of common public goals.
2. Methods of Communication: It has mechanisms of intercommunication among its members (e.g.
meetings, newsletters, forums).
3. Information Exchange: Members use these communication mechanisms primarily to provide
information and feedback to each other.
4. Genres: The community utilizes and hence possesses one or more genres to further its aims (i.e. it
has particular forms of communication, like reports, memos, academic articles, that members
recognize and use).
5. Lexis: In addition to genres, it has acquired a specific lexis (specialized terminology or jargon
understood by members).
6. Membership Expertise: It has a threshold level of members with a suitable degree of relevant
content and discoursal expertise (i.e. there are expert members; newcomers gain expertise to be
fully accepted) 28 .

In essence, a discourse community is defined by common communicative practices and norms rather
than by geographic or ethnic ties. For example, the international community of cardiologists can be seen as
a discourse community: they share goals (advancing cardiac health knowledge), communication channels
(conferences, journals), genres (case reports, research articles), specialized lexis (medical terminology), and
have experts vs. novices. Notably, members may come from different speech communities in the
sociolinguistic sense (different countries/languages), but within the discourse community they converge on
using English medical jargon in certain genres. The ontology here emphasizes functional unity: what binds
the community is how they discourse (write, speak in specific ways to each other).
Sociolinguistic and anthropological views on community have diversified. The discourse community concept
is one approach; another influential notion is the community of practice (CoP) (Lave & Wenger 1991,
applied to sociolinguistics by Eckert & McConnell-Ginet 1992). A CoP is a group of people who engage in a
joint activity or endeavor over time, developing shared practices (including linguistic ones) through mutual
engagement. The classic example in sociolinguistics is Eckert’s study of high school social groups (“jocks” vs
“burnouts”) – each group constituted a community of practice with its own linguistic norms emerging from
everyday social practice. The CoP concept shifts ontology from an externally defined group (like “the X
speech community” or “the Y discourse community”) to an internally arising group defined by practice and
interaction. It was, in part, a response to perceived shortcomings in the speech community concept (which
assumed cohesion and clear boundaries). In practice, discourse communities, speech communities, and
communities of practice are overlapping ways to conceptualize social groupings and their language.
Variationist sociolinguists traditionally worked with the speech community (e.g. “the speech community of
New York City English speakers”), assuming enough shared norms to study as a unit. Discourse community
has been more popular in applied linguistics and discourse analysis (especially writing studies, English for
Specific Purposes, etc.), where the interest is in how particular groups (academics, hobbyists, professions)
use language in context. Communities of practice have been embraced in sociolinguistic studies of style
and identity, highlighting smaller social networks and local meaning-making. All three frameworks agree that
communities are real in the sense that members recognize themselves as part of a group (“we scientists,”
“we members of this fan forum,” “we local residents”), but they draw boundaries differently – by broad
social criteria, by communicative behavior, or by shared endeavor.
Epistemology (How to study discourse communities?): To identify a discourse community, one typically
looks for institutionalized communicative practices. Swales’ approach was largely textual/genre
analysis: for example, to study the discourse community of academic researchers, he examined the genres
they produce (research articles, conference presentations, peer reviews) and the conventions those follow.
By analyzing a corpus of texts in a genre, one can infer the community’s norms (e.g. how papers are
structured, what citation style is used, what jargon appears). Ethnographic methods also play a role – for
instance, observing how members interact in situated events (faculty meetings, laboratory discussions) can
reveal how newcomers learn the discourse norms (through apprenticeship, mentoring, etc.). Interviews
and surveys can be used to ask members how they communicate: e.g. “Through what channels do you stay
updated in your field? What writing conventions do you find most important?” These help document the
self-understanding of the community.
In applied linguistics, researchers might do case studies of individuals navigating a discourse community.
For example, studying how a first-year graduate student acquires the discourse practices of
mathematicians: one could track their writing development, feedback from senior community members,
and participation in seminars – mapping how they move toward the community’s expert norms. This ties
into pedagogical concerns: knowing the characteristics of a discourse community allows teachers to induct

9

students into those practices (as in English for Academic Purposes courses teaching genre and lexis of
academic communities).
From a sociolinguistic variation perspective, a discourse community can be studied by looking at norms
and attitudes toward language within the group. For instance, researchers might measure if members
converge on certain technical terms (lexical variation) or if they come from different dialect backgrounds,
whether a common dialect leveling occurs in group settings (do people moderate their accent when
addressing fellow specialists?). The community’s boundaries can also be tested: Are outsiders able to
interpret the group’s discourse, or do they find it impenetrable? (Swales notes that having specialized
genres and lexis implies that non-members will likely struggle to fully participate, which is a hallmark of a
discourse community’s identity 29 28 .)
A key methodological challenge is validating the coherence of a discourse community. Unlike a
geographic speech community, a discourse community may be dispersed and defined by activity.
Researchers often use a mix of criteria (the six above) as a checklist. If a candidate group fails some criteria
(no clear goals, or no specialized genres), it might not qualify as a true discourse community. Sometimes
communities are nested or overlapping: for example, an academic department might itself be a discourse
community, while also being part of the larger disciplinary discourse community. Methodologically, one
might analyze at multiple levels (local practices vs. global conventions). Social network analysis can also
contribute: by mapping who communicates with whom (citation networks, email networks), one can see the
structure of the discourse community (hubs of expertise, peripheral members, etc.), which aligns with the
idea of threshold membership and information flow.
Critical and reflexive perspectives: The discourse community concept has been both useful and critiqued.
One critique is that it can imply a static and uniform group, glossing over internal diversity and power
dynamics. As H. G. Widdowson and others pointed out, simply identifying a discourse community doesn’t
address questions like: Who sets the discourse norms? Are there conflicts or subgroups? For example, the
“scientific discourse community” includes both seasoned editors of prestigious journals and junior
researchers; the former have far more power in determining acceptable discourse (what counts as a
publishable article). So, some analysts caution that we must consider power, authority, and hierarchy
within discourse communities – they are not egalitarian gatherings of like-minded peers, but often have
gatekeepers and novices, insiders and outsiders. This realization connects to the community of practice
framework, which explicitly models levels of participation (core members vs. peripheral participants). Over
time, newcomers ideally move from peripheral to full participation (Lave & Wenger’s legitimate peripheral
participation), but there can be barriers (e.g. socialization failures, exclusion).
Another challenge is the boundary problem: discourse communities often do not have clear-cut borders.
People can belong to multiple discourse communities simultaneously, or move between them. For instance,
one could be a member of the discourse community of environmental scientists and also of policymakers,
or an online fan-fiction writer who is also an academic librarian – each with different discourse norms. This
raises questions: Do we conceive of an individual as holding multiple discourse community memberships
that influence their language (perhaps leading to code or register switching between contexts)? Indeed,
applied linguists have explored how individuals manage hybrid identities and discourses. For example, in a
multilingual context, someone might belong to a local community using one language and a professional
discourse community using another (with its own jargon). Thus, the neat concept of a discourse community
may be complicated by globalization and the internet, where communication is not bounded by location or
singular group identity.

The speech community notion was similarly critiqued in earlier sociolinguistics – for presupposing too
much homogeneity and consensus. Bucholtz (1997) and Morgan (2014) argued that defining a speech
community often left out marginal voices and assumed shared norms that might not be so universally
shared (especially in socially stratified communities). The move to concepts like communities of practice was
partly to address these issues by focusing on smaller, activity-based groups and acknowledging variation
and conflict within communities. For discourse communities, some have proposed distinctions like
“imagined communities” (à la Benedict Anderson) to account for groups that feel like a community
without face-to-face interaction (e.g. a global online community of practice). The notion of imagined
discourse communities is relevant in digital communication: fans of a particular genre across the world may
feel part of one community through online discourse, yet they might never all interact directly. The shared
linguistic repertoire (slang, abbreviations, in-jokes) on a forum can function like the lexis and genres of a
discourse community, but leadership and membership are fluid.
Shifts in usage: In the 1990s–2000s, “discourse community” became a staple in academic writing research,
but more recently there’s been a shift to terms like “affinity spaces” (Gee) or continued use of CoP,
especially for online groups, to emphasize flexible membership and shared endeavors without strict
membership criteria. Applied linguists have debated the appropriateness of teaching students about
discourse communities: Some say it helps learners understand the target culture of a discipline, others
warn it can reify and stereotype academic discourse (“the academic community always writes like this”).
There’s also a pedagogical shift towards viewing novice writers as negotiating their identities between
home discourses and academic discourse (per New Literacy Studies, e.g. James Gee’s work), rather than
simply assimilating into a fixed academic discourse community.
In sociolinguistics, where earlier studies might have talked about an entire city as a “speech community,”
newer work might focus on smaller networks or practices. For instance, rather than assuming “all of
London” is one speech community, researchers examine how different communities of practice in London
(such as multiethnic youth peer groups) have their own norms that may diverge from an older local norm.
In effect, the idea of a monolithic speech/discourse community has given way to a more plural view of
communities. This doesn’t render the terms obsolete; instead, scholars use them carefully, often specifying
scope (e.g. “the professional discourse community of civil engineers in country X” or “the local speech
community of this neighborhood’s Spanish-English bilinguals”).
Ideological considerations: Discourse community boundaries can be invoked for inclusion or exclusion.
For example, the phrase “academic discourse community” can be used idealistically to encourage student
enculturation, or pejoratively to critique academic elitism. Reflexive scholarship asks: Who benefits from
defining this group’s discourse as the norm? and Whose voices are marginalized by these norms? These
questions tie the concept to larger discussions of language and power.
In summary, the discourse community concept has proven useful for analyzing shared communicative
norms in functional groups, and it complements variationist notions of speech community by focusing on
communicative purpose and genre. Over time, the field has shifted from viewing communities (whether
speech or discourse) as static containers of uniform norms to seeing them as negotiated, overlapping, and
dynamic ensembles of people. The ontology of “community” is now less essentialist – it’s something people
do (through communication and practice) rather than simply are. The epistemology has likewise shifted
toward methods that capture that dynamism: ethnography, longitudinal studies of socialization, and finegrained discourse analysis, alongside traditional text and frequency analysis. All these efforts aim to
understand how we come to know a community’s norms and boundaries – and increasingly, how

communities define themselves through discourse, sometimes in contestation with others or with internal
dissent, rather than being assumed homogenous by the analyst.
