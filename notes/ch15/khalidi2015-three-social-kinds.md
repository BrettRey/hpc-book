# Khalidi 2015 - Three kinds of social kinds (notes for Ch15)

## Central thesis
- Khalidi distinguishes three kinds of social kinds, all mind-dependent in some sense, but not equally suitable as natural kinds.
- The key discriminator is not mind-dependence but whether the properties associated with the kind are linked causally or merely by convention.

## The three kinds
1. **Attitude-independent social kinds**
   - Existence does not depend on attitudes toward the kind itself.
   - Examples: recession, racism.
   - People need not recognize or conceptualize the kind for it to exist.
2. **Kind-attitude-dependent social kinds**
   - Existence depends on attitudes about the kind, but not necessarily on attitudes toward every instance.
   - Examples: money, war.
   - The kind exists because of collective attitudes, but particular tokens can exist even if no one recognizes them at the time.
3. **Instance-attitude-dependent social kinds**
   - Existence of the kind and its instances depends on attitudes toward the kind and the instance.
   - Examples: prime minister, permanent resident (institutional roles).
   - These are heavily conventional and regulatory; membership is sustained by recognition and rules.

## Main argument against a simple mind-dependence test
- Mind-dependence does not imply ontological subjectivity in a way that disqualifies natural kinds. Psychological kinds are mind-dependent but still real.
- The useful distinction for realism is causal linkage vs conventional linkage among properties.
- Kind 3 fails natural kind status not because it is mind-dependent, but because its properties are conventionally linked by rule or regulation.

## Key conceptual moves
- Critique of Searle's picture: social kinds are not uniformly ontologically subjective in a way that blocks objectivity.
- Emphasis on causal cohesion: some social kinds have property clusters linked by causal mechanisms (candidate natural kinds).
- Conventional kinds are not necessarily unreal, but they do not have the same kind of causal unity.

## Relevance to Ch15
- Provides a typology for social categories like dialect, register, discourse community, and "native speaker":
  - Dialect and register likely fall into kinds 1 or 2 if their clustering is driven by causal mechanisms (learning, interaction, identity pressures).
  - Institutionalized roles (e.g., "native speaker" as credential, or standardized language requirements) resemble kind 3 due to formal recognition and regulation.
- Helps argue that mind-dependence does not eliminate realism: communicative situations can be mind-dependent and still be real HPC kinds.
- Supports the idea that the most important question is how properties cluster and why, not whether the category is socially constructed.

## Connections to HPC framework
- Kind 1 and 2 social kinds map well onto HPC kinds: property clusters maintained by causal mechanisms.
- Kind 3 kinds map to conventional clusters: properties linked by rules and institutions rather than homeostatic mechanisms.
- This provides a clean way to separate robust sociolinguistic kinds from purely administrative or legal categories.

## Drafting hooks / claims
- "Mind-dependence is a red herring; the real question is whether the properties are causally linked or merely conventional."
- "Some social kinds are natural in the HPC sense; others are institutional roles held together by regulation."
- "Dialects and registers can be real kinds without being essentialist, because their clustering is causal and historical, not merely conventional."

## Suggested placement in Ch15
- Use in the "native speaker" section to argue that official status markers are conventional (kind 3) while communicative competence clusters are causal (kind 1/2).
- Use in the dialect/register discussion to clarify which sociolinguistic categories are likely to be HPC kinds and which are conventional overlays.
- Use in methodology discussion to justify why sociolinguistic categories can be empirically studied even though they are socially constructed.

## Cautions
- Do not claim Khalidi thinks conventional kinds are unreal. He allows they are objective in some sense but not natural kinds because their property links are conventional.
- Be explicit that his triad is a spectrum of dependence, not a strict binary.


## Additional details
- Khalidi draws a strong distinction between categories (in our theories) and kinds (in the world). This helps Ch15: a category like "native speaker" may be a theoretical label that poorly tracks the underlying kind.
- His examples show that even apparently "institutional" kinds can have tokens that exist without recognition (money printed but not circulated), which supports the idea that attitude-dependence does not necessarily track token-dependence.
- He argues that mind-dependence is compatible with objectivity: the existence of minds is part of the natural world, so kinds that depend on minds are not thereby ontologically tainted.
- The decisive factor for natural-kind status is whether the associated properties are causally connected (homeostatic clustering) rather than conventionally linked.

## Extra Ch15 leverage
- Dialect features (phonology, lexicon, morphosyntax) are plausibly causally linked via social network structure and accommodation. That puts dialects in the "natural social kind" zone (type 1 or 2).
- Register features might be weaker: they may be more conventionally linked (highly situational, norm-driven). This suggests a continuum within the social kinds, which can be framed explicitly using Khalidi's taxonomy.
- "Native speaker" as a formal credential (institutional testing, immigration categories) is a kind-3 conventional kind, but "native speaker" as a lived competence cluster may be closer to kind 1/2. This allows the chapter to separate political/institutional uses from linguistic reality.
