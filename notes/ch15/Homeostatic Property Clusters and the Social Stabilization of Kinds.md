# Homeostatic Property Clusters and the Social Stabilization of Kinds

Homeostatic Property Clusters and the Social
Stabilization of Kinds
HPC Theory: Stability Through Homeostatic Mechanisms
The Homeostatic Property Cluster (HPC) theory of natural kinds (developed by Richard Boyd and others)
proposes that a kind is defined by a cluster of properties that tend to co-occur, maintained by some
underlying homeostatic mechanism 1 2 . In an HPC kind, most members share most of the cluster’s
properties, but no single property is essential – some members can lack certain properties and still
belong to the kind 1 . What makes it a stable kind is that some mechanism ensures these properties
continue to cluster together over time. In Boyd’s words, there is “some stable… set of mechanisms that causes
properties to cluster in a regular way” 3 , giving the kind its coherence. This homeostatic mechanism
keeps the cluster tight (i.e. maintains a “stable range of properties” 2 ) by counteracting forces that would
otherwise disperse the cluster. For example, in a biological species the mechanism might be interbreeding,
developmental constraints, or selection pressures that regulate trait variation. The key advantage of the HPC
view is that it accounts for the “non-accidental” clustering of traits in a kind without requiring a strict
essence 4 – instead, a causal mechanism (which can be quite complex) underpins the cluster’s stability.
Variation is expected in an HPC kind, but it is not dismissed as mere noise. Rather, variation is compatible
with – even integral to – the kind’s stability. The homeostatic mechanism tends to ensure that deviations
from the core property cluster have a low chance of persisting 2 . In other words, if an individual
member of the kind strays too far from the typical property profile, the mechanism will either bring it back
in line or limit its long-term success. For a biological species (the classic example of an HPC kind), the
homeostatic mechanisms can be intrinsic – e.g. gene flow within a breeding population or developmental
pathways – and/or extrinsic, such as environmental selection pressures 5 . These mechanisms actively
filter or correct variation. Mutations or atypical traits do occur, but under HPC homeostasis most of these
deviations do not last across generations (they are selected against or diluted by interbreeding), so the
cluster of species-defining traits remains intact 6 . Only occasionally – say, when a mutation is neutral or
advantageous – will a novel trait persist and spread, in which case the cluster can shift gradually to
accommodate it 6 . Thus, variation is not “noise” but the grist for the mill of the underlying
mechanism. The HPC framework embraces Darwinian population thinking: where traditional essentialist
views saw individual variation as an error or imperfection around an ideal type, HPC views it as the raw
material that homeostatic processes operate on to keep the kind cohesive yet adaptable over time 7
6 .
To illustrate, consider a stabilizing selection scenario in biology. Human birth weight is subject to variation,
but extremely low or high birth weights are selected against (due to higher mortality). The result is a stable
cluster around an optimal range. The variation hasn’t vanished – it’s visible in the bell-curve distribution of
birth weights – but the homeostatic mechanism (here, natural selection on infant survival) prunes the
extremes each generation, maintaining the integrity of the category (“healthy newborn”) within certain
bounds. Such examples show how an HPC kind remains stable because of population-level forces acting on
variation, not in spite of variation. Over short timescales, a species will indeed look like an HPC cluster with

1

most members sharing a suite of traits 8 . Over longer timescales the cluster can drift or split (speciation)
as new variations accumulate, but in the interim it was the homeostatic processes (interbreeding,
selection, etc.) that gave the species its cohesive identity 9 . In summary, HPC theory provides a “more
liberal approach to classification” that tolerates heterogeneity, focusing on the stability of the cluster
rather than any immutable essence 10 . The cluster’s stability is explained by mechanisms that actively
preserve the clustering of properties, keeping the kind empirically “projectable” (useful for induction and
prediction) even in the face of internal diversity 11 12 .

Social Mechanisms for Stabilizing Categories
Crucially, HPC theory does not require that the stabilizing mechanism be wholly internal to individual
members. In fact, Boyd’s account explicitly allows that the homeostatic causation can include external or
environmental factors 5 . This opens the door to thinking of social and cultural processes as
homeostatic mechanisms that stabilize property clusters – an idea that is HPC-compatible even if early
formulations didn’t emphasize it. The question posed in your scenario is: if each speaker has an internal
“coupling” that defines some category (like grammaticality in their own idiolect), how do we ensure that your
category and mine align so that we’re talking about “the same kind”? In other words, how are public,
shared categories possible if the cognitive mechanisms are individual? The answer, from an HPC or HPClike perspective, lies in social stabilization mechanisms: interactions across individuals that enforce or
encourage similarity, effectively coupling our categories together. Variation between individuals – far from
being irrelevant “noise” – is the signature of these broader-scale mechanisms at work.
Philosophers of social science and biology have extended the HPC framework to social kinds, arguing
that the stability of many human categories is maintained by social processes analogous to biological
homeostasis. Ron Mallon, for example, contends that certain entrenched social roles can produce HPC-like
kinds in the social domain 13 14 . On Mallon’s view, a human category (like a gender, occupation,
psychiatric diagnosis, etc.) can become “projectable” – meaning we can make reliable generalizations
about it – when there are “various social mechanisms [that] stabilize and entrench” that category 14 . In
other words, the category comes to correspond to a homeostatic cluster of properties in the population
because the social role provides a causal infrastructure that makes people in that category more similar to
each other than to outsiders. Members of the social kind tend to share a cluster of traits or behaviors not by
coincidence, but because the social environment generates self-reinforcing patterns (a social
homeostasis). For instance, consider a hypothetical social role “X”: there might be widely shared beliefs and
expectations about how an X should behave (common knowledge in the community), and institutions that
regulate or reinforce those behaviors 15 16 . Someone occupying the role X is subject to those
expectations – through training, norms, or even self-identification they come to exhibit the expected
property cluster. The feedback loop is clear: the category label and its associated norms cause individuals
to conform in many ways, and because many individuals conform, the stereotypes about the category are
reinforced and broadcast, entrenching the role further 15 13 . Mallon quotes Boyd’s HPC criterion directly:
what matters is that some stable set of mechanisms is causing the properties to cluster reliably, “producing
and sustaining” a property cluster kind that supports induction and prediction 3 . Here the mechanisms
are social – e.g. psychological tendencies (like conformity or stereotyping), communication networks,
legal or institutional definitions, stigma or prestige associated with the category, etc. 16 . These are all
external to any single individual, yet they act on individuals to keep the category’s content coherent
across the group.

An example can make this concrete. Take the category of a “professional violinist.” There is no single
essential trait that all violinists share beyond playing violin, yet as a social kind it tends to come with a
cluster of properties: certain hand callouses, a repertoire of Italian musical terms in memory, a typical range
of hearing ability, perhaps certain shared cultural experiences (like having gone to music school). How are
these properties stabilized? Through social mechanisms: training regimens, auditions, conservatory
curricula, peer expectations – all these factors homeostatically induce similar properties in those who
become violinists. If someone lacks all of those properties, they likely either will not be recognized as a
violinist or will acquire them through the socialization process of joining that community. The variation
among violinists (say one also plays jazz, another only classical; one has perfect pitch, another doesn’t)
doesn’t negate the kind – it’s variation around the cluster. As long as core practices (playing technique,
musical literacy, etc.) are maintained by the professional norms, the category remains well-defined and
publicly shared. In HPC terms, “being a violinist” is stabilized by a socially sustained homeostasis:
training and professional standards ensure a cluster of skills/properties, and deviations (e.g. someone who
claims to be a violinist but cannot read music or hold the bow properly) will tend not to persist in the role.
They’ll either drop out or quickly be corrected by teachers and colleagues – ensuring the cluster’s
integrity much as an organism’s repair mechanisms ensure functional integrity.
Notably, this perspective resonates strongly with Ian Hacking’s notion of “looping kinds” in the social
world. Hacking observed that when people are classified in a certain way (for example, diagnosed with
“schizophrenia” or labeled as “genius”), those classifications can “loop back” to affect how people behave,
how others treat them, and even how they self-identify – ultimately changing the kind itself 17 . A new
category or description can “make up people” by providing an intentional framework under which
individuals start to act 17 . This is essentially a homeostatic feedback loop: the label leads to interventions
or self-modifications that bring reality into line with the label’s content. For Hacking, and for Mallon building
on him, this explains how a novel social category can stabilize: once the category is public and broadcast by
credible sources (e.g. a medical authority defining a disorder, or a government creating a census category),
people begin to structure their behavior in light of that category, and institutions may enforce certain
treatments or expectations 18 19 . Over time, a cluster of properties (symptoms, behaviors, outcomes)
becomes reliably associated with membership in that category – not because those properties were an
inherent essence, but because the social system has created a self-fulfilling equilibrium. In Hacking’s
terms, the kind is interactive; in HPC terms, it’s an extrinsically homeostatic cluster. The messy
variation that might have existed initially (people with a mix of unrelated symptoms, say) gets channeled
and pruned by the social response, which might include standardized treatments, stereotypes, or support
groups that shape the experiences of the categorized individuals. The end result is a socially stabilized
kind: a kind we can talk about as if it were a natural kind, because it now has a fairly stable and projectable
cluster of properties due to collective behaviors.

Variation as a Multi-Scale Signal, Not Noise
From the above, we see a unifying theme: variation itself can be evidence of an underlying stabilizing
process at a higher level. Traditional formal theories in linguistics (e.g. Noam Chomsky’s competenceperformance distinction) often treated inter-speaker or intra-speaker variation as a kind of irrelevant “noise”
obscuring the pure signal of an idealized grammar. In contrast, an HPC-compatible view – especially when
considering language as a population phenomenon – treats variation as the “signature” of a larger-scale
mechanism. The subtle differences in how each person speaks or categorizes meanings are not merely
random; they often reflect systematic influences such as region, social group, or communicative
interaction. These influences are the higher-level mechanisms that, in aggregate, stabilize the language as a

3

whole. We can draw an analogy to ecology: one might be tempted to treat fluctuations in individual
animals’ traits as noise, but population-level processes (like competition or symbiosis) are at work, and
those fluctuations can reveal how the ecosystem maintains balance. In fact, biologists have noted that if
one isn’t careful, HPC thinking could scale up almost arbitrarily – one tongue-in-cheek example suggested
viewing “the vast network of ecological relationships that constitute the biosphere as a single homeostatic
property cluster maintaining polymorphism in ‘Gaia’” 20 21 . This was meant as a warning (HPC should not
be trivialized into a “universal solvent” that collapses everything into one giant kind 20 ), but it illustrates
that homeostatic clustering can, in principle, occur at many scales: from genes in a cell, to individuals in
a species, to interactions in an ecosystem. By the same token, languages and social categories operate
on multiple scales. Individual minds contribute internal consistency, while social interaction provides
external consistency. Variation is the bridge between these scales.
One insightful framework for this in cultural evolution is the idea of “cultural attractors,” proposed by Dan
Sperber 22 23 . A cultural attractor is essentially a stable equilibrium in the space of possible variations
of a cultural item – an equilibrium achieved not by perfect copying of an idea or behavior, but by biased
transformation of it. Sperber points out a puzzling fact: cultural items (stories, songs, customs, etc.) can
remain stable or self-similar over centuries even though each time they are transmitted, individuals
inevitably introduce small variations 23 24 . If everyone is imperfectly imitating or even deliberately
modifying the item, why doesn’t it drift beyond recognition? The answer is that not all variations are
equally likely. We have shared biases (cognitive, communicative, environmental) that systematically make
certain variants more likely to be adopted than others 25 . Over many transmission events, these biased
tendencies cause the variations to cancel out or converge, rather than accumulate randomly 26 . In
Sperber’s example, the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood has been told with countless small deviations, yet it
remains the same recognizable story: most storytellers, faced with an audience of children, tend to avoid
variants where everyone dies a horrible death, and tend to favor a moral and a happy resolution. This
selective bias (a shared human preference for certain narrative outcomes) is a social-cognitive mechanism
that “attracts” the tale toward a stable form 26 . Thus the macro-level stability is achieved despite
micro-level variation, because the variation is patterned by the attractor. The story’s public identity is
preserved by this implicit homeostatic process. We can see linguistic conventions in a similar light: for
instance, pronunciation of words may vary slightly across speakers and time, but biases (ease of
articulation, common speech rhythms, prestige accents) pull the variants toward a common “attractor”
pronunciation. Extreme deviations (mispronunciations) tend not to spread, because they get corrected or
don’t communicate effectively – they “have a low chance of persisting” in the population 2 . Meanwhile,
minor variations that do propagate often do so in a constrained way (e.g. a vowel shift that affects all words
in a category), which the community can adapt to. In the end, the language as a kind stays sufficiently
stable that speakers understand one another and agree on what counts as a well-formed utterance. From
an HPC perspective, the shared language is an HPC kind: a cluster of linguistic behaviors and judgments
maintained by a nexus of social interactions (conversation, accommodation, learning) and cognitive
constraints.
In short, the public, shared nature of categories comes from higher-level stabilizing dynamics that
mold individual variation. Each person’s internal “detector” for a category might click in a slightly different
way, but through continuous interaction, individuals influence each other and tend to synchronize on
similar category boundaries. This could be through direct feedback (e.g. explicit correction, teaching) or
through more diffuse social pressures (like convention and mutual expectation). The HPC framework
encourages us to view this “messy reality of variation” not as a threat to categories, but as evidence that a
collective mechanism is in operation at the group level. The variability is structured – often you can

4

identify subclusters or gradients linked to social factors – which implies some process is shaping it. For
linguists and cognitive scientists, this resonates with the idea that language is fundamentally a shared,
population-level phenomenon (a point made in usage-based and evolutionary linguistics). For example,
William Croft argues that linguistic categories (like word classes or constructions) are better seen as
populations of usage events rather than Platonic kinds – more akin to species in an ecosystem 27 28 . In
such a view, what we call “English” or “French” are clusters of utterances and idiolects that persist over
generations due to continuous cultural transmission. The overlap of successive generations of speakers
and the feedback of interaction create a homeostatic regime where, despite gradual change, each
generation’s language closely resembles the last’s 27 29 . Variation is the engine of change, but also the
target of stabilizing forces like the need for mutual intelligibility and social conformity.
To summarize, HPC-compatible conceptions of social stabilization highlight that categories remain
shared and meaningful not by each individual independently inventing the exact same internal structure,
but by individuals being embedded in larger systems that coordinate those structures. In biology, the
system might be a breeding population or an ecological niche; in human society, it’s our communication
networks, institutions, and collective attitudes. These systems supply the homeostatic “glue” that
binds our individual cognitive categories into a stable public kind. Variation is the observable trace of this
multi-level process: rather than being an irritant, it’s a clue that a kind’s stabilizer is operating at the
population level. Modern approaches ranging from social ontology in philosophy to cultural evolution in
anthropology are converging on this truth. They show that one can maintain a form of kind-realism (the
idea that categories like “grammatical sentence” or “mental disorder” refer to real groupings) without falling
back on strict internal essences – so long as we recognize that reality’s kinds can be stabilized by
feedback loops, whether neural, genetic, or social. In the context of your chapter “The Social Stabilization
of Kinds,” the take-home message is: public categories exist and endure because our social interactions supply
homeostatic mechanisms that synchronize and sustain those categories across minds. This is entirely in line with
(and indeed an extension of) the HPC framework: it’s the same principle of homeostasis-through-variation
applied to the social realm. The truth we’re after is that human kinds are often homeostatic property
clusters writ large, with society itself acting as the stabilizer to keep the cluster of properties tight
enough for the kind to persist and be shared by all of us 14 3 .
