# Nölle et al. 2018 - The emergence of systematicity (notes for Ch15)

## Scope and thesis
- Experimental semiotics study using a silent gesture paradigm to test when systematicity evolves.
- Central claim: Systematicity evolves adaptively in response to specific environmental and communicative affordances, not just internal cognitive bias.
- Key findings: Systematicity is promoted by (1) structure in the environment (traits that are discriminative get systematized), (2) open environments (new referents constantly appearing), and (3) displacement (communicating about absent referents).

## Core construct: Environmental Conditioning
- Linguistic structure is contingent on the structure of the referent environment.
- **Openness**: When the set of referents is closed/fixed, idiosyncratic (holistic) signs are efficient. When the set is open/expanding, systematic (compositional) signs win because they are productive.
- **Displacement**: When referents are visible (co-present), you can point or use local analog cues. When referents are displaced (requires memory), systematicity wins because it compresses information. Systematic categories are "chunking" algorithms for working memory.

## Key Experiments
- **Experiment 1**: Tested "functional adaptivity" (do speakers systematize the trait that is most discriminative in the set?) -> Yes. They systematize what is useful.
- **Experiment 2**: Tested "openness" (changing referents) and "displacement" (referents removed before gesturing).
    - **Openness effect**: Systematicity increased over time in open environments.
    - **Displacement effect**: Displacement caused a main effect jump in systematicity from the start.

## How this helps Ch15
- **Mechanism for Section 15.4 (Conditioning Structure)**: This paper provides the experimental mechanism for *why* the conditioning structure exists. It's not just "we learn what we hear"; it's "we structure what we need to handle."
- **Displacement = Abstraction**: Validates the claim that grammatical categories (kinds) are tools for handling displaced/abstract references. The "mixed bin" example in Ch15 talks about conditioning on the source; this shows how the source (environment) conditions the form.
- **Scale Invariance**: Examples of small-scale experimental evolution match the large-scale social evolution described in the chapter.

## Drafting hooks / phrasing ideas
- "Systematicity is a compression algorithm for working memory." (Use for the displacement argument.)
- "When the environment gets too big to point at, the grammar gets systematic."
- "The conditioning structure is an adaptive response to openness and displacement."
- "Grammar doesn't just track the environment; it compresses it."
