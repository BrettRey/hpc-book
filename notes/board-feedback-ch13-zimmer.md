The "Stack" metaphor is serviceable, but it feels a bit bloodless for a system this dynamic. When I read "stack," I think of pancakes or computer memory—inert layers resting on top of one another. But your text describes something far more biological: a shift from physical constraints (the throat's physics) to cognitive habits (memory) to social agreements (constructions). It feels less like a vertical architecture and more like an evolutionary transition, like moving from single-celled organisms to complex multicellular life. You might consider framing it as a "gradient of constraint" rather than a stack. The phoneme is constrained by the body; the morpheme by the brain; the construction by the crowd. That progression gives the reader a narrative arc—a journey from the inside out—rather than just a structural diagram.

"Stabiliser-weighting" is a heavy, industrial term for what is essentially a mixing board. I struggled to visualize it until I hit the 2D map in Figure 13.3. To make this stick for a lay audience, you need to make the mechanisms feel like active antagonists to entropy. Right now, "stabiliser" sounds passive, like a strut on a bridge. But these mechanisms are fighting a war against noise and forgetting. The *pin/pen* merger example is excellent because it shows the mechanism *failing*—that’s the dramatic hook. I’d love to see that sense of struggle applied to the morphemes too. Why does "went" survive? Not just because of "frequency"—that’s a statistic. It survives because it is used so often it carves a canyon in the mind that water (usage) naturally flows into. Give the mechanisms verbs; make them *do* work.

The empirical grounding is solid, particularly the Labov vowel merger and the Bybee regularization data. These are the "fossils" that prove the theory. However, the section on HistWords and vector embeddings feels a bit disconnected, like we’ve suddenly jumped from natural history to computer science. If you can, bridge that gap by explaining *why* the computer sees what it sees. The vectors are just tracing the path of the cultural drift you just described. Don't let the methodology obscure the phenomenon: words drifting like continents until they are no longer recognizable. The "negative cases" are actually your strongest asset here. Showing where the theory breaks (Academic Register) proves it isn't just a "Just So Story" that explains everything and therefore nothing.

To clarify the central insight, I would lean harder into the "transparent vs. opaque" distinction in Section 13.3. That is the lightbulb moment. The idea that at the bottom level, the sound *is* the job, whereas at the middle level, the sound is just an arbitrary tag for the job, is profound. It explains why we can tolerate a "pin/pen" merger (the transparency is lost, but context saves us) but we can't tolerate a "go/goed" merger without social cost. You are describing how language manages risk. At the bottom, the risk is physical (mishearing); higher up, the risk is social (misunderstanding). The mechanisms shift to match the risk profile. If you frame it as "risk management by the brain," the lay reader will immediately grasp why the mechanisms have to change as you move up the ladder.
