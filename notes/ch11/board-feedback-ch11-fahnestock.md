# Board Feedback: Chapter 11 (Word Classes as HPC Kinds)
## Jeanne Fahnestock

The mechanism-braiding argument is your strongest move in this chapter, and it *is* a figura — though not a traditional one. Let me unpack both what's already working rhetorically and what could be tightened.

### 1. Rhetorical Figures Doing Argumentative Work

Your chapter is built on **antimetabole** (terms swapped for conceptual turnover): "semantic fact becomes syntactic fact; syntactic fact entrenches semantic property." This reversal does real work — it dissolves the apparent boundary between levels. You're not just claiming they interact; you're showing *which direction* the entrenchment flows, and the chiastic structure makes that directionality visible.

The **interrogative puzzle** section (\mention{wh}-words as variables over alternatives) uses **gradatio** — a laddering through "neither deictic nor anaphoric, yet saturated because alternatives-based." Each step up the ladder adds a new constraint, building inevitability. This works. Don't lose it.

The adverb-as-fat-category example in your outline relies on **contraposition** — showing what *fails* to be an HPC by contrast with what *succeeds*. The negative diagnosis (Chapter 8's principle applied) strengthens the positive claim. This is already implicit; make it explicit.

### 2. Mechanism-Braiding as Figura

Yes. Mechanism-braiding is a figura—specifically, **epanodos** (AB, then BA recirculation). The pattern is:

- *Deixis creates referential saturation* (A → B)
- *Referential saturation creates distributional resistance* (B → pattern)
- *Distributional resistance reinforces saturation through learning* (pattern → B → A)

The mechanism isn't just the cause of the surface pattern; the surface pattern *loops back* and sustains the semantic condition that motivated it in the first place. This is the figura of **reciprocal causation made visible**. It's epistemic scaffolding: readers see the same elements (saturation, resistance, entrenchment) circulating through each other, which makes the HPC claim *inevitable* rather than stipulated.

You might strengthen this by naming the circuit explicitly: *"Saturation motivates resistance; resistance entrenches saturation. The category stabilizes by circulating through its own mechanisms."*

### 3. Figures for the Cross-Linguistic Asymmetry Argument

The asymmetry (nouns/verbs universally robust; adjectives/adverbs variable) currently rests on structural explanation alone. You need figures that *embody* why cross-linguistic stability and variability track different mechanistic depth.

**Recommended additions:**

- **Zeugma** (one governor, two complements): *"Noun-verb stability explains typological universals and individual acquisition simultaneously."* This compresses the insight that mechanisms operate at multiple scales. One predicate (the category's homeostasis) governs both the universal pattern and the learning trajectory.

- **Anadiplosis** (end-word of one clause opens the next) to chain the causal chain: *"Nouns project across languages; languages that stabilize nouns reinforce nominal mechanisms; nominal mechanisms support cross-linguistic predictability."* This creates the sense that universal stability *emerges* from maintained mechanisms, not from abstract universals.

- **Antithesis** (balanced contrast without inversion): *"Adjectives remain variable because their clustering is thin; verbs remain stable because their clustering is deep."* This isn't mere repetition—it shows that *depth of clustering* is the engine of both stability and variation. It's not that adjectives are "optional" and verbs are "necessary," but that the mechanisms maintaining each differ in robustness.

The key move: Don't just *tell* readers that mechanisms explain asymmetry. *Show* the recirculation between local mechanisms and global patterns using figures that embody recursion, depth, and scale. That's how readers feel the argument's necessity rather than merely following its logic.

Your mechanism-braiding is a breakthrough. Make it visible.
