# Feedback on Chapter 11: The Zoo of Words

Brett, this chapter is where your biological parallel stops being a polite metaphor and starts doing the heavy lifting. You’re arguing that "parts of speech" aren’t a neat periodic table of elements; they’re an ecosystem. Here is how I’d make that land for the *New York Times* reader.

### 1. Mechanism-Braiding: The "Shark and Dolphin" Problem
You need a visual for how different internal causes produce the same external shape. In biology, we call this **convergent evolution**.

A shark and a dolphin look remarkably similar: streamlined fusiform bodies, dorsal fins, pectoral flippers. Why? Not because they are related—one is a fish, the other a mammal. They look alike because physics imposes a penalty on drag. The water forces them into the same shape.

Your "determiner resistance" is the water. It’s the hydrodynamic constraint.
*   **Deixis** (*today*) is the shark: ancient, direct, cold-blooded context.
*   **Anaphora** (*who*) is the dolphin: a complex, warm-blooded social reference to something else.
*   **Interrogatives** (*who?*) are the ichthyosaurs: a third lineage entirely.

They all "braid" together into the "No Determiner" category because they have all solved the problem of *reference saturation*. If you simply call them all "Pronouns," you are making the pre-Darwinian mistake of classifying whales as fish just because they swim.

### 2. N/V vs. Adjectives: The Skeleton vs. The Plumage
To explain why Nouns and Verbs are universal but Adjectives are flaky, use **comparative anatomy**.

Every vertebrate needs a spine and a skull (Nouns and Verbs). You cannot build the organism of a sentence without referencing *things* and *events*. These are the hard bones. They are conserved across the phyla of languages.

Adjectives are **plumage**. Some birds, like peacocks (English), have exploded this category into a massive, colorful display. Others, like the kiwi, have almost none. Some languages don’t even bother growing "adjectives"—they just use verbs to do the job (saying "the leaf greens" instead of "the green leaf"). Nouns and verbs are essential organs; adjectives are evolutionary luxury.

### 3. The Narrative Arc: "The Anatomist's Table"
Don't start with the definitions. Start with the **dissection**.
1.  **The Wastebasket**: Open with Adverbs. Show us the pile of mismatched bones found in the corner. It’s not a skeleton; it’s just the stuff that didn't fit elsewhere.
2.  **The Spine**: Show us the Noun/Verb stability. The predictable engineering.
3.  **The Mimics**: End with the "Pronoun" revelation. We thought these were simple "function words," but under the microscope, we see three different species evolving the same camouflage to survive the hydrodynamic drag of the sentence.

Make the reader feel like a naturalist realizing that the "smooth gray swimmer" in the water is actually three different beasts.
