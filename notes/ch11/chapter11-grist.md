# Chapter 11 Grist: Lexical Categories

## Focus modifiers and \mention{wh}-word clustering (Dec 20, 2025)

From squib work on *exactly who* vs. *the person exactly who*:

The "pronoun" or "\mention{wh}-word" category isn't a unified HPC — it's multiple overlapping clusters with different mechanisms at each level:

| Property | Deixis (*today*) | Anaphor (rel. *who*) | Interrogative (*who?*) |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Determiner resistance | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Focus-modifier licensing | ✗ | ✗ (integrated) / ✓ (fused) | ✓ |
| Morphological paradigm | ✗ | partial | partial |

**Key insight**: Determiner resistance comes from referential saturation at the DP level, achieved by different routes:
- Deixis: contextually saturated
- Anaphor: bound variable
- Interrogatives: open variable over alternatives (neither deictic nor anaphoric)

But focus-modifier licensing (*exactly*, *precisely*, *just*) is a distinct property that comes apart from determiner resistance in relatives — fused relatives allow it (\mention{wh}-word foregrounded), integrated relatives don't (\mention{wh}-word backgrounded). Explained by Cuneo & Goldberg's BCI principle.

**Possible worked example**: CGEL classifies *today/tomorrow/tonight/yesterday* as pronouns on semantic and distributional grounds, but morphologically they're unlike typical pronouns. Compare *Monday* — also deictic, also resists determiners. The resistance may be a feature of deixis itself, not pronoun-hood.

### The mechanism-braiding insight

What starts as a **semantic fact** (redundancy — no need to determine or modify when reference is already clear through deixis or anaphor) becomes a **syntactic fact** (these words distributionally resist determiners and modifiers) **because the category is maintained by braided mechanisms**. The semantic property gets entrenched into the grammar.

This is the HPC story in miniature: functional pressure → entrenchment → distributional pattern → reinforcement through learning and use. The "resistance" isn't an arbitrary syntactic stipulation — it's a grammaticalized reflex of referential saturation.

**The interrogative puzzle**: Interrogatives resist determiners too, but they're *neither* deictic *nor* anaphoric. So the "redundancy" explanation doesn't apply directly. What saturates them?

Possible answer: Interrogatives are **variables over alternatives** — the question semantics already provides the domain of quantification. There's nothing for a determiner to restrict because the \mention{wh}-word ranges over the entire alternative set by definition. The saturation is *functional* (alternatives-based) rather than *indexical* (context-based), but the syntactic consequence is the same.

This might be a case where **different mechanisms converge on the same distributional property** — a nice illustration of how HPC kinds can have the same surface clustering for different underlying reasons

## Adverb as fat category?

The adverb "wastebasket" (cf. Chapter 8 fat clustering) — unlike nouns/verbs/adjectives, adverbs may not form a genuine HPC. Consider as negative example in this chapter.

## Pro-form gender paper (primary source)

**File**: `/Users/brettreynolds/Documents/LLM-CLI-projects/HPC book/literature/pro-form_gender.tex`

Brett's paper "Personhood and pro-forms: A hierarchical analysis of gender in Modern English" (targeting Folia Linguistica) treats **pro-form** as a semantic category — items whose interpretation is anaphoric or deictic — with gender constraints applying at this semantic level.

**Key relevance for Chapter 11**:
- "Pro-form" is a semantic/functional category, not a syntactic one
- The paper explicitly notes (§5.7) that CGEL classifies *today/tomorrow/tonight/yesterday* as pronouns, but what matters is their pro-form function
- The hierarchical structure (personal/non-personal → epicene/sexual | locative/temporal) shows how different mechanisms produce the surface clustering
- Determiner resistance comes from **referential saturation** — a semantic property — that gets grammaticalized differently across pro-form types

This paper is direct evidence for the Chapter 11 argument that "pronoun" and related categories are heterogeneous HPCs with different underlying mechanisms producing overlapping surface distributions.

**TODO**: Update `reynolds2025proform` bib entry when submitted to Folia Linguistica or accepted.

## Action Items from Board Review (Dec 25, 2025)

### 1. The Core Narrative: "The Anatomist's Table" (Zimmer/Croft)
Structure the chapter as a dissection lesson that reveals the "lie" of the dictionary list.
- **The Wastebasket**: Start with Adverbs. Show the mess. A collection of fossils and functional scraps (Millikan).
- **The Skeleton**: Move to Nouns/Verbs. The predictable, universal organs required for reference and predication.
- **The Mimics**: End with "Pronouns/\mention{wh}-words." They look like a unified class ("function words"), but they are mimics.

### 2. Key Metaphor: Convergent Evolution (Zimmer)
- **Determiner Resistance = Hydrodynamic Constraint**.
- **Deixis = Shark** (ancient, context-dependent).
- **Anaphor = Dolphin** (relational, complex).
- **Interrogatives = Ichthyosaur** (alternative-ranging).
- They all look the same (no *the*) because they solve the same problem (reference saturation), but their internal biology (mechanisms) is totally different.

### 3. Visualization (Tufte)
- **Three-Panel Convergence**: Show three distinct upstream paths (Deixis, Binding, Alternatives) converging on the exact same downstream output (Blank Determiner Slot).
- **Labeling**: "Same effect, different cause."

### 4. Theoretical Refinement (Millikan/Baker)
- **Interrogatives**: Their "saturation" isn't indexical. It's **restriction**. The \mention{wh}-word *is* the restrictor of the alternative set. Adding 'the' would be double-restriction.
- **Adjectives (Skeleton vs Plumage)**: N/V are essential organs. Adjectives are evolutionary luxury (plumage). Some languages have none (just verbs).

### 5. Acquisition Check (Tomasello/Ambridge)
- **The Twist**: Children learn the **strands** first (item-based *today*, *who*).
- The "Braid" (the unified category of "determiner-less things") is an **adult/transmission illusion** created by compression (Kirby).
- If children learned the braid first, they would make cross-strand errors (e.g., *the who*). They rarely do.
