Adjective variation does parallel pronoun heterogeneity, but only in a qualified way. In pronouns, a single distributional property (determiner resistance) masks distinct mechanisms (deixis, anaphora, interrogation). For adjectives, we also see a single label covering multiple routes into the syntax: underived adjective roots, stative verbs used attributively, nouns pressed into modifier service, and relative-clause strategies. The shared surface (attributive slot, predicate slot, degree marking) can be maintained by different stabilizers: derivational morphology, copular predication, or discourse-functional economy. So yes: "adjective" can be a braided HPC, not a single mechanistic cluster, especially in languages where property concepts are chiefly verbal or nominal. The parallel is not perfect, because pronouns are tied to reference and deixis, whereas adjectives are tied to predication; but the diagnostic warning is the same.

The semantic types matter. Dixon's earlier work already shows that dimension, age, value, and color are the "core" types most likely to form a small adjective class. In HPC terms, dimension adjectives (big, long) align with scalarity and degree morphology; their mechanism profile includes gradability, comparative paradigms, and high token frequency. Age terms are often relational to temporal deixis (young, old) and may pattern with participles or stative verbs; they are less stable as a pure adjectival class. Color terms frequently derive from nouns (gold, ash) or are part of a closed set tied to cultural categories; they can show nominal morphology or classifier interaction, a different stabilizing route. Physical property terms (hard, wet) tend to behave like dimension, but may be verb-like in some languages. The upshot: semantic type predicts which mechanisms (degree, derivation, predication, classifier alignment, discourse frequency) do the homeostatic work. This predicts why some languages allow color terms only in predicate position, while dimension terms readily occupy attributive slots with the same adjective morphology intact.

There is a real "fat category" risk in word class typology. The adverb label is the obvious wastebasket, but "adjective" can also balloon if we lump participles, relative clauses, and noun modifiers together under one heading. The HPC diagnostic should be applied: do these items support projectible inferences across contexts, or are we merely naming a shared function? If property concepts are split between verb-like and noun-like strategies, then "adjective" is a thin or fat category depending on the language. The safe typological move is to separate mechanism profiles and only posit a unified class where clustering is robust across morphology, syntax, and acquisition.
