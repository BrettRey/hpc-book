# Board Feedback: Chapter 11 (Lakoff)

**Subject:** The Metaphorical Shift in Chapter 11

Brett,

I’ve reviewed the outline and the "grist" for Chapter 11. You are engaging in a necessary exorcism of the **Container Metaphor**, which has held linguistics captive since Aristotle.

### 1. The Conceptual Shift
The shift you are asking readers to make is from a **Static Objectivist** ontology to a **Dynamic Experientialist** one.
The classical view—the target of your critique—relies on the metaphor **CATEGORIES ARE CONTAINERS**. This logic dictates that a category is a bounded region in mental space. Things are either *in* or *out*. This entails the "Law of the Excluded Middle" and the search for "Necessary and Sufficient Conditions" (the walls of the container).
Your chapter demands a shift away from boundary-enforcement (defining the walls) toward stability-maintenance (understanding the forces). You are asking linguists to stop looking for the *edges* of the box and start looking for the *glue* that holds the pile together.

### 2. The New Metaphor: The Braided Rope
The metaphor that naturally replaces the Container is **THE CATEGORY IS A BRAIDED ROPE**.
This fits your "mechanism-braiding" terminology perfectly.
*   In the Container metaphor, unity comes from the boundary.
*   In the Braid metaphor, unity comes from the friction and interleaving of distinct strands (mechanisms).
No single strand runs the entire length of the rope (just as no single property defines "Noun" across all languages or even all contexts), yet the rope is strong and functional. The "surface unity" you speak of is the resulting cable, distinguishable from the environment not by a sharp line, but by the density of the interaction.

### 3. Braiding and Radial Categories
This is where your work reinforces mine. My theory of **Radial Categories** describes the *topology* of the category: there is a central prototype (e.g., the "mother" who is birth+genetic+nurturing+married-to-father) and radiating extensions (adoptive mother, birth mother).
Your **Mechanism-Braiding** explains the *physics* of that topology.
*   **The Prototype** is the section of the rope where *all* the mechanism-strands (semantic pressure, syntactic distribution, morphological paradigms, acquisition routines) are tightly braided together. It is the "thick" part of the category.
*   **The Radial Extensions** are the frayed ends or thinner sections where only one or two strands continue.
*   **The Adjective-Adverb Asymmetry**: You mention this in the outline. In my terms, Adjectives have a tight braid (strong prototype); Adverbs are a loose bundle of unbraided fibers (the "wastebasket").

If you frame Chapter 11 this way, you validate the cognitive reality of prototypes not just as "psychological effects" but as the inevitable result of multiple causal mechanisms overlapping.

**George**
