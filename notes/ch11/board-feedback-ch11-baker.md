As a generativist, I would want the chapter to acknowledge universals: not just cross-linguistic stability, but the claim that the grammar supplies a limited inventory of category-defining features and structural positions. For me, N and V are not statistical clusters but primitives of the computational system, visible in syntax (argument structure, movement, binding) and in morphology. Adjectives are a dependent or reduced class, and adverbs largely a derivative of adjectival structure. So I would like the text to signal that the universals here are deep architectural constraints, not merely typological tendencies.

Where HPC diverges from formal approaches is in its metaphysics and explanatory burden. The HPC view treats categories as homeostatic clusters stabilized by extra-grammatical mechanisms and tolerates graded membership; formal approaches treat categories as discrete, formally specified features in narrow syntax. HPC allows field-relative projectibility and even multiple overlapping kinds, whereas formal work insists on a single inventory tied to grammatical well-formedness. This makes HPC more permissive about adjective/adverb variability and mixed or "dual" members, while a generative account seeks a precise mapping from lexical items to syntactic heads. I'd want the chapter to note that this is a shift away from the idea that categories are fixed primitives of the grammar.

Shared ground does exist. Both perspectives reject surface-definitional lists and treat categories as explanatorily potent generalizations. Both recognize a noun/verb split and expect a systematic asymmetry between adjectives and adverbs, even if the mechanisms differ. The HPC idea of architectural equilibrium can align with generative notions of structural economy, acquisition biases, and interface pressures that stabilize the categories. If the chapter frames HPC as explaining why the syntactic universals I care about are resilient despite variation, then the positions converge: the generativist gets universals, while HPC supplies a causal story for their stability and for exceptions.
