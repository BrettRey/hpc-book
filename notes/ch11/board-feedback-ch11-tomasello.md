# Board Feedback: Chapter 11 (Word Classes)
**Reviewer:** Michael Tomasello

The re-framing of word classes as Homeostatic Property Clusters (HPC) offers a welcome, robust metaphysical grounding for what we observe in the acquisition data. For too long, generative approaches have assumed categories like 'Noun' and 'Verb' are innate primitives, present from the start. The data simply do not support this.

**1. Acquisition Evidence as HPC Confirmation**
The strongest evidence for word classes as HPCs comes from the "Verb Island" hypothesis. Early on, children do not possess a general, abstract category of "Verb." They have item-based schemas: they know how "kick" works, and they know how "kiss" works, but they do not generalize rules across them. The category "Verb" emerges only later, gradually, as a cluster of distributional and functional properties. The HPC framework captures this perfectly: the category is not a pre-existing box but a statistical density that solidifies over developmental time. The "fuzziness" inherent in HPCs is not a bug; it is the central feature of the ontogenetic process.

**2. Learning Without Instruction**
Children solve the categorization problem through pattern-finding and distributional analysis. They track the "company words keep." If *dax* appears in the frames "I __ it" and "She __ed the ball," the child aligns it with other items sharing those distributional slots. Crucially, this is an active construction process, not passive labelling. The HPC model allows for this: the "cluster" is the result of the child detecting stable correlations in the input (morphology, syntax, and semantics) and reinforcing them through usage.

**3. The Role of Intention-Reading**
However, distributional analysis alone is insufficient. The "homeostasis" of these clusters is heavily maintained by intention-reading. A child cannot form the category "Noun" without understanding the communicative act of *referring*, nor "Verb" without understanding *predicating*. We categorize words together not just because they take the same suffix, but because we use them to do the same things socially. Your chapter must emphasize that the "mechanisms" maintaining these clusters are socio-cognitive: the child’s drive to understand the adult’s communicative intention is what binds the disparate properties of form and function into a coherent, projectible kind.
