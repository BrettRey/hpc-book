From an RCG standpoint, mechanism-braiding is the sort of multi-source conventionalization that yields a constructional category. RCG rejects autonomous syntactic categories; categories are abstractions over constructions. The "braiding" story maps onto RCG's usage-based entrenchment: a semantic or pragmatic property (referential saturation, alternatives, redundancy) motivates a distributional constraint (determiner resistance); repeated usage entrenches it; later it appears as a constructional convention. The key point is that distinct mechanisms can converge on the same constructional pattern, yielding a surface category that is not a single causal kind. That is consistent with RCG: nodes in the constructional network can share form-meaning alignment without sharing a single underlying mechanism; the abstraction is secondary, not ontological. That matches RCG's view that generalizations are descriptive conveniences, not strictly explanatory essences in themselves.

For wh-words and pronouns, I would treat "pronoun" as a cover label for multiple constructional families: deictic pro-forms, anaphoric pro-forms, and interrogative operators. The chapter should resist a unified HPC claim and instead present a family-resemblance topology. Show that determiner resistance is a distributional commonality produced by different functional mechanisms (indexical saturation, variable binding, alternative-set quantification). In RCG terms, the category is a generalization over constructions with partially overlapping semantic maps, not a taxonomic essence. I'd recommend (i) a typology table (deictic/anaphoric/interrogative, with mechanisms), (ii) the mechanism-braiding narrative for the shared distribution, and (iii) a warning that labels (pronoun, wh-word) are derivative of constructional behavior. This is also where your "pro-form" semantics can do real work: a functional category that cuts across morphosyntax. The Cuneo and Goldberg BCI contrast in relatives is ideal: it shows that the same form can be differently entrenched depending on its constructional role.

On "adverb" and the Ch 8 fat-category diagnosis, the RCG perspective is that adverb is the classic wastebasket: a residue of modification constructions at different scopes (VP, clause, discourse, degree). These are distinct constructions with distinct meanings and constraints, so any cross-constructional "adverb" generalization will be weakly clustered and low in projectibility. If Chapter 11 wants an internal negative example, adverb is perfect: it shows how a label can be descriptively useful yet fail the homeostasis test. The chapter can connect this to the RCG warning against reifying distributional labels; "adverb" is at best a comparative concept, not a robust constructional kind. That ties neatly to Ch 8's fat clustering and to your broader point that mechanism-braiding can create apparent unity even when underlying mechanisms diverge.
