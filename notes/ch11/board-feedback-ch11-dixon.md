# Board feedback on Chapter 11 (Dixon)

1) Cross-linguistic adjective variation is a diagnostic for mechanisms, not a defect in categorization. Where languages have a small adjective class, the same semantic domains recur, and other concepts are distributed to verbs or nouns. That pattern suggests multiple stabilizers: lexical semantics (property concepts are more name-like), morphosyntax (relativization, modification, degree), and discourse-pragmatic packaging (attribution vs predication). In HPC terms, the adjective space is a cluster held together by mechanisms whose weights differ across languages. Variation thus tells us which mechanisms are robust (recurrent semantic types) and which are replaceable (morphological expression, syntactic slot). The point is not that adjectives are absent, but that the cluster can be stabilized by different architectural equilibria.

2) The chapter should use the Dixon typology as an empirical scaffold, not as an essence. The semantic types (dimension, age, value, color, physical property, human propensity, speed, etc.) are comparative concepts indicating where adjective classes are most likely and where a small class concentrates. Use this typology to make predictions: if a language has a minor adjective class, it should be drawn from these domains; if property concepts are expressed as verbs/nouns, these domains resist the shift. Then connect those predictions to mechanisms (acquisition bias, frequency, morphosyntactic economy, information structure). In short, the typology should function as a diagnostic for the HPC profile, not as a definition.

3) Pitfalls to avoid: (i) treating English as the template and forcing other languages into it; (ii) conflating semantic categories with morphosyntactic word classes; (iii) using typology as a checklist rather than as a distributional constraint; (iv) overclaiming uniformity and missing mixed systems and gradient cases; (v) slipping into circularity, where "adjective" is defined by behaviors used to prove its existence. Keep the typology descriptive, keep mechanisms explanatory, and treat variation as evidence, not anomaly.
