Howard Becker-style board feedback (Ch. 11)

You can show linguists something they could not see by making the chapter a camera, not a gavel. Start from familiar puzzles (nouns/verbs look stable; adjectives/adverbs drift; "pronoun" splinters) and re-center the same data around mechanism-braiding. The gift is a new contrast: what looks like a single surface class is often a stable effect produced by different routes. Use the focus-modifier case as a worked demonstration. The linguist already sees determiner resistance; you show that one distributional fact can arise from deictic saturation, anaphoric binding, or alternative-sets, and that this convergence is the phenomenon. The chapter can read like: "Here is a pattern we all agree exists; here are mechanisms that yield it; now notice how this changes what counts as evidence." That is a lens, not a fight.
Flag the noun/verb stability as the baseline case, and treat adjective/adverb variation as the testbed for the framework itself.

Community dynamics: expect people to read this as a turf move. You will get pushback from those invested in clean diagnostics, from typologists who need stable comparanda, and from formalists who hear "mechanism" as psychologizing. Some will hear sociology smuggled into grammar; others will hear category skepticism. Plan for different landings. The wise move is to show where the framework helps each group do what they already want: typologists get a principled story for why nouns/verbs are robust while adjectives/adverbs are the site of variation; formalists get sharper predictions about clustering; usage-based folks get a causal account that does not collapse into description. Saying "this is compatible with your best work; it re-sorts the evidence" de-escalates boundary politics.

How to avoid sounding like you are correcting the discipline: shift from "they got it wrong" to "we have been asking a different question." Say you are adding a layer: a mechanism story that explains why diagnostics sometimes work and sometimes fail. Use modest verbs: "suggest," "lets us notice," "may help explain," rather than "refutes." When you must criticize, praise the data and labor: "The diagnostics were good enough to uncover the instability; the HPC view tells us what to do with it." Put your strongest claim into a careful example instead of a manifesto. Let the reader feel the insight in miniature before you name it. If the chapter reads like a method note from a colleague who likes the field, it will be read that way.
