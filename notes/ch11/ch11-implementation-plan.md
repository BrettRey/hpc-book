# Chapter 11 Implementation Plan: Lexical Categories and Their Maintenance

**Date**: 2025-12-25
**Status**: PLAN ONLY — NOT FOR EXECUTION

---

## Goal

Draft Chapter 11 ("Lexical Categories") applying the HPC framework to word classes. The chapter should demonstrate that:
1. Nouns and Verbs are robust cross-linguistic HPCs maintained by converging mechanisms
2. Adjectives are thinner HPCs with variable maintenance
3. Adverbs fail the HPC test entirely ("fat category" / wastebasket)
4. "Pronoun" and "wh-word" are braided categories where distinct mechanisms converge on identical surface distributions

---

## Core Narrative: The Anatomist's Table (Zimmer/Morris)

Structure the chapter as a dissection that reveals the "lie" of the dictionary list.

### Three-Act Structure

| Act | Title | Content |
|-----|-------|---------|
| **Act I** | The Wastebasket | Open with Adverbs. Show the mess: manner, degree, focus, discourse connectives crammed together. No unified proper function (Millikan). "Excellent storage capacity, terrible explanatory power." |
| **Act II** | The Skeleton | Move to Nouns/Verbs. The predictable organs required for reference and predication. Cross-linguistically robust. Skeleton vs. Plumage (N/V vs Adj). |
| **Act III** | The Mimics | End with the Shark/Dolphin reveal. "Pronouns" (deixis, anaphor, interrogative) converge on determiner resistance through *different* saturation routes. Same surface, different biology. |

## Key Metaphor: Convergent Evolution (Zimmer)

**Determiner Resistance = Hydrodynamic Constraint**

| Category | Analogy | Saturation Route | Proper Function (Millikan) |
|----------|---------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Deixis (*today*) | Shark (ancient, cartilaginous) | Context saturation | Anchor reference to demonstrative space |
| Anaphor (rel. *who*) | Dolphin (mammal, warm-blooded) | Bound variable | Create bound-variable dependency |
| Interrogative (*who?*) | Ichthyosaur (marine reptile, extinct) | Alternatives-based domain | Delineate alternatives, restrict quantifier domain |

The parallel: sharks, dolphins, and ichthyosaurs all evolved streamlined bodies not because they share ancestry but because physics imposes a penalty on drag. Likewise, deixis/anaphor/interrogative all "resist determiners" because referential saturation makes a determiner functionally redundant — but the saturation is achieved by different routes.

**Developing the Ichthyosaur (Interrogative) Strand:**
- Interrogatives aren't saturated by context (deixis) or by prior antecedent (anaphor)
- Their saturation is *restriction*: the wh-word *is* the restrictor of the alternative set
- Adding "the" would be double-restriction — imposing an external determiner on something that already ranges over alternatives
- This is why *the who* sounds wrong not because it's redundant, but because you're trying to restrict a restrictor
- Baker's formalist translation: [wh]/[Q] features occupy the C-system, competing with D-system; head competition excludes overt determiner

## Sections Outline

### §11.1 — Hook: In Medias Res (The Mess)
- Open directly with the adverb wastebasket: *quickly*, *absolutely*, *however*, *frankly*, *moreover* — what do these have in common?
- Show the mess before explaining it. Let the reader feel the category's incoherence.
- Then pull back: "This chapter is a dissection. We will find what holds together and what doesn't."
- **Scope framing:** "This chapter doesn't catalog every word class. It asks what makes a category cohere — or fail to cohere. We examine four major classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) and one apparent class (pronouns) that turns out to be several. The closed functional categories — determiners, prepositions, conjunctions — are a different story, better left to typological specialists."
- Epigraph: Wallace on mimicry — "the resemblance of one animal to another is of exactly the same essential nature as the resemblance to a leaf, or to bark, or to desert sand, and answers exactly the same purpose"

### §11.2 — The Wastebasket (Adverbs as Negative Case)
- No unified proper function (Millikan): manner ≠ degree ≠ evidential ≠ discourse marker
- Grammaticalisation cline (Bybee): adverbs are a holding pen for items at various stages
- Kirby's prediction: heterogeneity should fragment unless protected by frequency (fossils)
- Connect to Ch 8 "fat category" diagnosis
- **Visualization (Tufte)**: Properties scattered, no central hub

### §11.3 — The Skeleton (Nouns and Verbs)
- Cross-linguistic robustness: reference + predication as core discourse functions
- Skeleton vs. Plumage (Zimmer/Dixon): N/V are essential organs; Adj is luxury
- Mechanisms: acquisition, distributional entrenchment, discourse frequency, morphological agreement
- Formal features as internal coding (Baker): HPC provides causal ecology for why features are projectible
- **Visualization (Holmes)**: Properties connected to central hub, thick continuous threads

### §11.4 — The Adjective Asymmetry (Developed)

**Why adjectives are "thinner" than N/V:**

| Property | N/V Mechanism | Adjective Mechanism | Consequence |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Core discourse function | Reference (N) / Predication (V) — universal | Attribution — optional | Weaker functional pressure |
| Morphological entrenchment | Case, agreement, TAM (rich paradigms) | Degree marking, comparison (sparse) | Less morphological glue |
| Cross-linguistic robustness | Every language has N/V slots | Many languages lack distinct Adj class | Less typological stability |
| Acquisition | Early, robust (concrete/action primitives) | Later, gradual (property concepts derived) | Slower entrenchment |

**Semantic type predicts mechanism (Dixon):**
- **Dimension** (big, long): high frequency, gradability, degree morphology → tighter clustering
- **Age** (young, old): relational to temporal deixis, may pattern with participles → looser
- **Color** (red, green): often derived from nouns (gold, ash), closed class in some languages → variable
- **Value** (good, bad): highly evaluative, prone to grammaticalization → unstable clustering

**The key insight:** Adjectives are "plumage" (Zimmer) — evolutionary luxury, not essential organs. They emerge where discourse economy creates a niche (property modification), but the niche isn't deep enough to produce N/V-level homeostasis.

**Comparative concept framing (Haspelmath):** "Adjective" as a comparative concept is useful, but it's a *looser* HPC than N/V. Different languages fill the property-concept slot with verbs, nouns, or a small closed class. The mechanisms vary; the surface label obscures this.

### §11.5 — The Mimics: Convergent Evolution in "Pronouns"
- The puzzle: *today*, relative *who*, interrogative *who?* all resist determiners — why?
- Three saturation routes:
  - Deixis: context saturation (Indexical)
  - Anaphor: bound variable (Binding)
  - Interrogative: alternatives-based domain (Restriction)
- Millikan: one surface fact, three proper functions
- The Shark/Dolphin metaphor deployed here
- **Three-Panel Convergence Diagram (Tufte)**:
  - Left: Deixis → no determiner
  - Middle: Anaphor → no determiner
  - Right: Interrogative → no determiner
  - Label: "Same effect, different cause"

### §11.6 — The Acquisition Twist (Tomasello/Ambridge)
- Children learn the strands first, not the braid
- *today* as holophrase; *who* via interrogative frame
- Lack of cross-strand errors (*the who*) suggests functional islands, not unified category
- The "braid" is an adult/transmission illusion (Kirby)
- Entrenchment curves should differ across the three routes (Ambridge's test)

### §11.7 — Worked Example: Focus Modifiers and Fused Relatives
- *exactly who* (interrogative) vs. *the person exactly who* (integrated relative)
- Cuneo & Goldberg's BCI principle: backgrounded constituents resist foregrounding
- Shows that mechanism-braiding produces *different licensing* for formally similar items
- Connects to pro-form gender paper (Reynolds)
- **Potential empirical backing:** Goldberg collaboration (data collection late Jan/Feb 2026) testing BCI predictions on precision modifiers. If results are available before press, incorporate as empirical support. See `/Focus_modifiers_interrogative_heads/GOLDBERG-COLLABORATION.md`.

### §11.8 — Summary and Connection to Part III Architecture
- Recap: N/V = tight HPC; Adj = thinner HPC; Adv = no HPC; "Pronoun" = braided HPC
- The form-meaning pairing as typical HPC architecture (CxG connection)
- **Field-relative projectibility (Ch 6 payoff):**
  - Morphology cares about word class differently than syntax: *cattle* is morphologically singular, syntactically plural
  - Typology cares differently than a single-language grammar: Haspelmath's comparative concepts are projectible *across* languages; language-particular categories are projectible *within*
  - The "right-sized category" depends on what questions you're asking — this explains why adjective debates persist (different subfields have different right-sized cuts)
- Forward pointer to Ch 12 (grammatical categories)

## Rhetorical Moves (Fahnestock)

| Figure | Deployment |
|--------|------------|
| **Antimetabole** | "Semantic fact becomes syntactic fact; syntactic fact entrenches semantic property." |
| **Epanodos** | Saturation → Resistance → Entrenchment → Saturation (loop) |
| **Zeugma** | "Noun-verb stability explains typological universals and individual acquisition simultaneously." |
| **Antithesis** | "Adjectives remain variable because their clustering is thin; verbs remain stable because their clustering is deep." |

## Community Dynamics (Becker/McCloskey)

- **Anticipated pushback**: Typologists (stable comparanda), Formalists (psychologising), Usage-based (smuggling sociology)
- **Rhetorical strategy**: "This is compatible with your best work; it re-sorts the evidence."
- Deference first: cite CGEL, acknowledge diagnostics, concede successes
- Modest verbs: "suggests," "lets us notice," "may help explain"
- Put strongest claim into worked example (§11.7), not manifesto

## Acquisition Evidence Needed (Ambridge)

The chapter asserts mechanism-braiding without testing it. Need at least one of:

1. **CHILDES corpus analysis**: Track determiner errors across deixis/anaphor/interrogative contexts separately
2. **Experimental comprehension**: Do acceptability judgments cluster by mechanism or surface property?
3. **Entrenchment robustness**: Do deixis patterns stabilize faster than interrogative?

**Fallback**: Propose experiment as prediction rather than claim established result.

## Epigraph Candidates

**Recommended:**
> "The resemblance of one animal to another is of exactly the same essential nature as the resemblance to a leaf, or to bark, or to desert sand, and answers exactly the same purpose."  
> — Alfred Russel Wallace, "Mimicry, and Other Protective Resemblances Among Animals" (1867)

*Rationale:* Wallace on mimicry directly sets up the convergent evolution theme without being too on-the-nose about convergent evolution itself. The quote is about *resemblance* and *purpose* — fitting for a chapter about surface similarity masking different mechanisms.

**Backup:**
- Bates: "the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation" (too explanatory)
- Darwin on convergent evolution (too on-the-nose)

## Verification Plan

1. **Build verification**: `latexmk -g hpc-book.tex` compiles without error
2. **Cross-reference check**: All `\ref{}` and `\label{}` resolve
3. **Advisory board review**: Run multi-agent review after draft complete
4. **Word count**: Verify ~6000 words

---

## NOT FOR EXECUTION

This plan documents the synthesis of 25+ board feedback files. It should be reviewed and approved before drafting begins.

**Key decision points for user**:
1. Approve the three-act structure (Wastebasket → Skeleton → Mimics)?
2. Approve the Shark/Dolphin metaphor as central?
3. Approve proposing (rather than claiming) acquisition evidence?
4. Choose epigraph?
