# Feedback on Chapter 11: Mechanism-Braiding and Category Unity
**From:** Joan Bybee

The "mechanism-braiding" insight you describe in the Chapter 11 notes—where semantic facts become syntactic facts through entrenchment—aligns perfectly with a usage-based understanding of language change, provided you explicitly acknowledge **frequency of use** as the engine of this process.

### 1. Frequency as the Weaver
You ask how entrenchment explains the braiding. In my view, the "braid" is the diachronic accumulation of usage events. The transition from a semantic fact (e.g., *today* is referentially saturated and thus redundant with a determiner) to a syntactic fact (determiner resistance) is mediated by repetition. 

Speakers do not calculate referential saturation in real-time for every utterance. Rather, high-frequency items like *today* or *who* occur often enough that their specific morphosyntactic patterns (in this case, the zero-determiner construction) are stored as autonomous chunks. The functional pressure (redundancy) motivates the initial omission, but **frequency** is what entrenches that omission as a distributional constraint. The "syntactic rule" is simply the calcified habit of the semantic redundancy, protected from analogical leveling by its own high frequency (the conserving effect).

### 2. Adverbs as a "Fat Category"
I strongly agree with the characterization of adverbs as a "fat category" or wastebasket. From a grammaticalization perspective, "adverb" is not a unified natural kind but a holding pen for items at various stages of the grammaticalization cline. 

Unlike Nouns or Verbs, which represent fundamental cognitive partitions (arguments vs. predicates), adverbs are derived from diverse sources—noun phrases (*today*), prepositional phrases (*overboard*), or adjectives (*quickly*)—that have started down the path of decategorialization but haven't yet reduced to bound morphemes. They do not cluster tightly because they are historically heterogeneous; they are grouped together only by a loose functional similarity (modification) rather than a shared developmental history or a tight homeostatic cluster.

### 3. Convergence and Apparent Unity
You note that distinct mechanisms (deixis vs. variable binding) converge on the same property (determiner resistance). This is a classic example of **grammaticalization channels** creating an illusion of category unity.

There are limited structural positions available in a language. As different forms erode and generalize (driven by frequency), they often slide into the same "slots." Both deictics and interrogatives are high-frequency function words. High frequency drives reduction and rigidification. They shed peripheral markings (like determiners) because they are highly predictable in context. The "unity" of the pronoun/\mention{wh}-word category is not an essence they share, but a result of parallel erosion processes. They look like a cluster because the river of usage has worn them down into similar shapes.
