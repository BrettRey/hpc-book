# Chapter 11 Feedback: Word Classes

## Where the chapter needs flesh

**The mechanism-braiding narrative needs a full worked example, not a sketch.** You have the pro-form paper and the wh-word clustering work—use them. A reader unfamiliar with your prior work can't visualize how different mechanisms (deixis, anaphoricity, quantification) converge on the same distributional property (determiner resistance). Build it step by step: semantic pressure → entrenchment pattern → learning reinforcement. Show the reader *why* the surface clustering persists even as the underlying causes diverge. One case in depth beats three cases in outline.

**The contrast with nouns and verbs needs defending on mechanism grounds, not just observational grounds.** You say nouns and verbs are cross-linguistically stable while adjectives and adverbs vary. Why? What mechanisms lock down noun-hood and verb-hood? Is it acquisition robustness? Discourse frequency? Cross-cultural alignment pressure? If you can't say, say that—but don't leave it as brute fact. The reader should feel the difference in *mechanistic depth*, not just taxonomic distribution.

**Adverbs-as-fat-category deserves its own section.** This is a perfect negative diagnosis case (Ch 8 payoff). Adjectives form a stable cluster; adverbs don't. Why? Is it because "adverb" lumps manner modifiers, speaker-oriented markers, discourse connectives, and aspectual auxiliaries? If so, the failure isn't empirical—it's taxonomic. Unpack the failure as evidence that the category itself is unhomogeneous. This strengthens the whole HPC apparatus.

## What throat-clearing should be cut

**Open with the paradox, not the premise.** You don't need to announce that word classes are "fundamental to generative grammar." Every linguist knows this. Start with the asymmetry: nouns and verbs are cross-linguistically robust; adjectives and adverbs fracture. Make the reader sit with that tension before you explain it. Urgency first, scaffolding later.

**Avoid the "one more thing" syndrome.** If the chapter is about word classes and mechanism-braiding, don't dilute it with tangential cases. The pro-form work is rich; the wh-word clustering is genuine. But don't also add phonological contrasts, register effects, and pragmatic labels as "related" phenomena. You did that work in earlier chapters to establish the scope of HPC kinds. Here, stay put. Depth over breadth.

**Cut any meta-commentary about "previous theories."** Phrases like "unlike generative approaches, we ask not what divides these categories but what holds them together" are editorial scaffolding. They're true, but they slow the reader down. Show the difference through the work itself—what you ask and how you answer it will make the contrast obvious. Trust the argument.

## Sentences to protect

When you're revising, protect these moves (or their functional equivalents):

1. **Any sentence that names a mechanism by name and shows it at work.** If you write "Acquisition pressure locks in noun properties; discourse frequency reinforces verb stability"—*that sentence does work*. It's not illustrative; it's explanatory. Protect it.

2. **Sentences that hold a contrast steady.** When you juxtapose nouns against adjectives, or deixis against anaphoricity, the clarity of that juxtaposition is the whole point. If a sentence makes the difference clear without flourish, leave it alone.

3. **Any sentence where you correct yourself or catch yourself in an assumption.** These moments—"or rather," "that is to say," "the question is not whether but why"—are where readers trust you most. They're the signs of thinking, not performance. Keep them.

4. **The sentence (or passage) that best explains why mechanism-braiding matters.** You have a unique insight here: different causes converging on the same effect is *not* a problem for natural kinds; it's what natural kinds *are*. When you articulate that, protect it. It's the keystone of the chapter.

## Editorial instinct

The chapter wants to do two things: solve a problem and reveal a principle. The problem is the adjective-adverb mess. The principle is that surface unity can arise from diverse mechanistic sources. Right now, the grist material emphasizes the problem. Push harder on the principle. Let the problem illustrate it.

One more note: Your pro-form paper has real force here. Don't bury it as a reference. Make it visible. A reader should finish this chapter and immediately want to read your account of why *today* matters as much as *she* for understanding categories. You've earned that currency—spend it.
