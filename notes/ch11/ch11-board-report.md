## PANEL 1: TYPOLOGY & RCG (Codex)

### Martin Haspelmath (Comparative Concepts)
**Verdict: Distinguish Comparative Concepts from Language-Particular Categories**
- **Core Advice**: Use HPC to explain *why* certain comparative concepts (N, V) are stable attractors, not to claim they are universal categories.
- **N/V vs Adj**: Nouns/Verbs track core discourse functions (reference/predication) with strong reinforcement. Adjectives have multiple recruitment paths (verbal, nominal).
- **Fat Categories**: Adverbs show the heterogeneity—adpositions, case-marked NPs, ideophones. Ideal for illustrating "fat clustering."

### William Croft (Radical Construction Grammar)
**Verdict: Mechanism-braiding is Constructional Convergence**
- **Reframing**: "Braiding" is multiple functional distinct constructions converging on the same surface distribution.
- **The Pronoun Case**: "Pronoun" is a cover label for deictic, anaphoric, and interrogative constructions. They share a map region (referential saturation) but have different causal histories.
- **Adverbs**: The classic wastebasket. A residue of modification constructions at different scopes.

### R.M.W. Dixon (Basic Linguistic Theory)
**Verdict: Semantic Type Predicts Mechanism**
- **Adjective Split**: Dimension, age, value, color types often have different stabilizing mechanisms (degree morphology vs. classifier interaction).
- **Typological Warning**: "Adjective" can be a thin or fat category depending on the language. Safe move: separate mechanism profiles.

### Mark Baker (Generative Syntax)
**Verdict: Features as Internal Coding of HPCs**
- **Bridge**: Formal features are the grammar-internal coding of stabilizers. HPC narrates the external causal ecology (acquisition, usage) that makes the coding reliable.
- **Interrogatives**: [wh]/[Q] features explain determiner resistance via head competition (C-system vs D-system). Alternatives-based saturation is the functional driver; features are the implementation.

## PANEL 2: USAGE-BASED & EVOLUTION (Gemini)

### Adele Goldberg (Construction Grammar)
**Verdict: Constructions are the Stabilizers**
- **Mechanism**: "Distributional consistency" in argument structure constructions (Transitive, Intransitive) stabilizes N/V categories.
- **Preemption**: Learners retreat from overgeneralization via statistical preemption. This is the mechanism for boundary maintenance.
- **Value Add**: HPC provides the *causal explanation* for why certain clusters are attractors.

### Joan Bybee (Usage-Based)
**Verdict: Frequency is the Weaver**
- **The Braid**: The transition from semantic redundancy to syntactic constraint is mediated by **repetition**. High-frequency items (*today*, *who*) are stored as chunks.
- **Adverbs**: Holding pen for items at various grammaticalization stages. Grouped only by loose function.
- **Convergence**: Deictics and interrogatives erode into similar shapes ("slots") because of high frequency.

### Michael Tomasello (Acquisition)
**Verdict: Children Learn Strands, Not Braids**
- **Developmental Reality**: Children do not initially learn "Determiner Resistors." They learn *today* (holophrase) and *who* (interrogative operator) separately.
- **Diagnostic**: If it were a unified HPC for the child, we'd see cross-strand errors (e.g., *the who*). Lack of error suggests they remain distinct functional islands.
- **The "Category"**: Emerges later as a schema over these islands.

### Simon Kirby (Iterated Learning)
**Verdict: Transmission Creates the Braid**
- **Compression**: Learners group referentially saturated items into a single distributional category to save cognitive effort. The "braid" is a compression heuristic.
- **Adverbs**: If "adverb" is truly a wastebasket, it should fragment or regularize unless protected by high frequency (fossils).
- **Mechanism**: Transmission forgets the "why" (redundancy) and remembers the "what" (distribution).

## PANEL 3: CATEGORIZATION, PHILOSOPHY & ACCESSIBILITY (Copilot)

### Eleanor Rosch (Prototype Theory)
**Verdict: Prototypes are Emergent, Not Explanatory**
- **Distinction**: Prototypes describe the organization; mechanisms explain the stability. Don't collapse them.
- **Adjective/Adverb**: Different maintenance regimes. Adjectives stay tight; adverbs scatter.
- **Evidence**: Need acquisition and dissociation data (aphasia, novel coinage) to prove mechanisms.

### Ruth Millikan (Teleosemantics)
**Verdict: Distinct Proper Functions**
- **The Core**: One surface fact (determiner resistance), three proper functions (Deixis, Binding, Alternative-ranging).
- **Interrogatives**: Proper function is to *delineate alternatives*, not context saturation. Adding 'the' violates this function.
- **Adverbs**: No unified proper function. "Garbage collection bin."

### Ben Ambridge (Psycholinguistics)
**Verdict: Needs Longitudinal Proof**
- **The Test**: Do children apply determiner resistance categorically (braid) or specifically (strands)?
- **Entrenchment Curves**: If braided, entrenchment curves for deixis/anaphor/interrogative should track together. If distinct, they should differ.
- **Requirement**: Must cite or propose longitudinal corpus analysis or comprehension experiments.

### Edward Tufte (Data Viz)
**Verdict: Visualize the Convergence**
- **Proposal**: Three-panel diagram (Deixis/Anaphor/Interrogative) with distinct upstream paths converging on identical downstream output (Determiner Resistance).
- **Adverbs**: Contrast "Mechanisms reinforce" (N/V, centripetal arrows) with "Mechanisms scatter" (Adverb, disjoint clouds).

### Carl Zimmer (Accessibility)
**Verdict: Convergent Evolution & The Anatomist's Table**
- **Metaphor**: **Convergent Evolution**. Shark (Deixis) and Dolphin (Anaphor) look alike because of "hydrodynamic constraint" (Determiner Resistance).
- **N/V vs Adj**: **Skeleton vs Plumage**. N/V are essential organs; Adj is evolutionary luxury.
- **Narrative**: Start with the **Dissection**. 1. The Wastebasket (Adverbs). 2. The Skeleton (N/V). 3. The Mimics (Pronouns - the Shark/Dolphin reveal).

## SYNTHESIS: KEY THEMES

| Theme | Key Proponents | Insight |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **Mechanism-Braiding as Convergent Evolution** | Zimmer, Millikan, Kirby | Shark/Dolphin metaphor. Distinct proper functions/histories converge on same surface constraint (hydrodynamics/saturation). |
| **Transmission Creates the Braid** | Kirby, Bybee | Learners compress diverse functional inputs into a single distributional category to save cognitive effort. |
| **Children Learn Strands First** | Tomasello, Ambridge | Lack of cross-strand errors implies children treat Deixis/Anaphor/Interrogative as distinct islands initially. |
| **N/V vs Adj Asymmetry** | Zimmer, Haspelmath, Dixon | Skeleton vs Plumage. N/V are core/stable; Adj is variable/peripheral. |
| **Adverbs as Wastebasket** | Zimmer, Croft, Millikan | "Fat category". No unified proper function. Collection of fossils. |
| **Visualization of Convergence** | Tufte | Need to show distinct upstream paths converging on identical downstream output. |

## ACTION ITEMS FOR CH 11

1.  **Narrative Structure (The Anatomist's Table)**: Adopt Zimmer's arc. Start with the mess (Adverbs), find the bones (N/V), reveal the mimics (Pronouns/\mention{wh}-words).
2.  **The Shark/Dolphin Metaphor**: Use Zimmer's convergent evolution image to explain "mechanism-braiding." "Determiner resistance" is the hydrodynamic constraint.
3.  **Refine the Interrogative Argument**: Use Millikan's "Alternative-ranging" function. It resists determiners because it *is* a restrictor, not because it's context-saturated.
4.  **Add Acquisition Nuance**: Acknowledge Tomasello/Ambridge's point: children start with strands. The "braid" is the adult/system-level state, or the result of transmission compression (Kirby).
5.  **Visualize the Convergence**: Create the Tufte three-panel diagram.
6.  **Typological Safety**: Use Haspelmath's "Comparative Concept" distinction. Don't claim "Adjective" is a failed category; claim it has a different, looser maintenance regime.
