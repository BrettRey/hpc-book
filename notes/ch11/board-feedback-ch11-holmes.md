# Nigel Holmes on Chapter 11: Word Classes

## The Visual Challenge

You've spotted the central tension beautifully: nouns and verbs are stable across languages (robust HPC kinds), while adjectives and adverbs leak and drift (thin or fat clustering). But abstract stability is *invisible*. Readers see the data — adjectives behave messily — and conclude there's no pattern. Your job is to make the mechanism-braiding *visible* in a way that honors that complexity.

## 1. The Keyhole Metaphor

Think of each word class as light shining through a keyhole. **Same wall, different holes.**

From the front (semantic face), nouns and verbs each cast a coherent shadow: roughly thing-denoting and process-denoting. But turn the wall sideways (distributional properties) and the light fragments. Adjectives scatter because the mechanisms maintaining them are weaker — entrenchment doesn't hold as tightly, learning transfers less reliably. Adverbs fragment into several different holes entirely.

The visual here is simple: a single light source, multiple keyholes, casting overlapping but distinct shadows on the linguistic landscape. The mess isn't noise—it's the signature of mechanisms operating at different pressures. Label the holes: acquisition, lexical entrenchment, discourse frequency, phonological constraints. Show how nouns benefit from all of them in tandem; show how adverbs benefit from only some, inconsistently.

## 2. Playfulness Without Academicism Drift

Your fear is legitimate: infographics can trivialize. The remedy isn't to hide the playfulness—it's to make it *earn its keep* architecturally. 

Use visual puns that do conceptual work. For instance: show a **three-strand braid** (semantic, morphosyntactic, discourse) holding together a noun, then show the same three strands unraveling for an adverb. The braiding literally enacts the mechanism-braiding insight. This isn't cute because the visual structure *maps onto the argument*. 

Palette restraint helps credibility: two or three colors, sans-serif typography, proper spacing. Edward Tufte's principle: high data-to-ink ratio. Every element should answer why it's there. A child's drawing of a braid is charming; a professional representation of a three-strand braid with labeled strands is both clear and rigorous.

## 3. The Single Figure That Carries Everything

**A two-panel comparative matrix, titled "Stability vs. Scattering."**

**Left panel (NOUNS):** Property cluster with eight properties (animacy marking, countability, possessive behavior, plural formation, determiner co-occurrence, case marking, referential centering, morphosyntactic role). All eight properties are *connected* by visible threads to a central node labeled "core mechanisms." The connections are *thick and continuous*.

**Right panel (ADVERBS):** Same eight properties, but only four connect to the central node. The other four float, each tethered to *different* sub-mechanisms (suffix-based derivation, discourse positioning, scope interpretation, register-marking). The threads are *thin and dashed*. Some properties appear on both panels but in different colors to show they operate under different regimes.

**The visual payoff:** Readers instantly grasp that stability isn't about essential properties—it's about *integration*. When mechanisms are braided together, the whole holds. When they come apart, you get the polycentric mess of the adverb class.

Include a small legend explaining what each thread represents (a miniature apparatus-schematic in the corner). This legitimizes the playfulness by reminding readers they're looking at a *functional model*, not decoration.

## 4. One Structural Suggestion

Position this figure *early* in the chapter, before you spend 3,000 words on the data. Readers who see the architecture first will interpret the messy details as *evidence* rather than *problems*. The grist materials show you have rich examples (temporals like *today*, pronouns, focus-modifiers)—let the matrix guide readers through the detail with confidence.

Make the chapter's prose follow the visual's logic: move from the stable cluster (nouns) through intermediate cases (adjectives) to the scattered category (adverbs and the pronoun puzzle). The figure becomes a **roadmap**, not an ornament.

**The core principle:** Infographics earn academic credibility by doing epistemic work, not by trying to disappear into the background.
