Your mechanism-braiding story is powerful, but it requires **longitudinal acquisition data to distinguish genuine mechanism-braiding from surface convergence**. Here are three critical empirical questions.

## 1. What Experimental Evidence Distinguishes HPC from Convergence?

The core claim: children learn surface distributions (e.g., determiner resistance) *before* understanding the heterogeneous mechanisms that produce them. This creates an apparent unity—an entrenchment effect—that masks the underlying braiding.

**The test:** You need dissociation studies in child speech. If braiding is real, we should see:

- **Early stage**: Children apply determiner resistance categorically across deixis, anaphor, and interrogatives (surface generalisation)
- **Intermediate stage**: Overgeneralisation errors *emerge* as children discover mechanism-specificity (e.g., attempting *the who?* in contexts where pragmatic alternatives should bar it)
- **Late stage**: Selective retreat as mechanisms lock in separately

Without overgeneralisation data, you're just describing the final state. **Can you find or run a corpus analysis of child speech that shows this progression?** If children never try *the who?* or *the today*, then the surface clustering may not be entrenched at all—it may simply reflect independent mechanisms doing the work from the start.

Alternatively: **priming or comprehension studies**. If the three saturation routes are braided, facilitating one (e.g., deixis via contextual setup) should prime acceptance of determiner resistance in the other two (anaphor, interrogatives). If they're independent mechanisms, no priming should occur.

## 2. Does Entrenchment Differ Across the Three Saturation Routes?

This is the entrenchment question I care most about.

Deixis is **temporally primary**—children have deictic systems (here, now, there, then) before they master anaphora or interrogatives. If mechanism-braiding is real, we should expect:

- **Deixis**: Entrenchment fast and robust. Determiner resistance here is cognitively fundamental (context saturation). Errors rare.
- **Anaphor (relative clauses)**: Entrenchment slower. Relative clause acquisition is notoriously protracted (late childhood/adolescence). Errors more frequent and longer-lasting.
- **Interrogatives**: Entrenchment depends on *when* wh-questions are acquired. If questions emerge late, but children have already learned "saturation = no determiner" from deixis, they may misapply the pattern, creating a different error signature than anaphor.

**The prediction**: Plot entrenchment curves separately for each route. If they're braided, the curves should show different slopes, different error rates, different asymptotes. If they're unified, the curves should overlap.

**What would surprise me**: If all three show identical developmental timecourses. That would suggest the property isn't about the heterogeneous mechanisms at all—it's a unified categorical distinction you haven't yet identified.

## 3. How Should the Chapter Use Acquisition Data to Test Braiding?

The chapter needs **three concrete acquisition arguments**:

**A. Longitudinal corpus analysis** (CHILDES or comparable)
- Track determiner errors across deixis, anaphor, interrogative contexts separately
- Show emergence of mechanism-specificity: where do children initially confuse the patterns? What error trajectory?
- This directly tests the "surface convergence masked by entrenchment" claim

**B. Experimental comprehension study** (existing data or propose one)
- Present children with marginal or context-atypical uses: *the today* (weak context), *the who* (integrated relative), *exactly what?* (interrogative with focus modifier)
- Ask: Do acceptability judgments cluster by mechanism (deixis/anaphor/interrogative) or by the surface property (saturation)?
- If braiding is real, younger children should show **undifferentiated acceptance** (all three saturated categories look the same), while older children **differentiate by mechanism**

**C. Entrenchment robustness test** (longitudinal or experimental)
- For each saturation route, test whether errors diminish with exposure/frequency
- Do deixis patterns stabilize faster than interrogative patterns?
- This directly measures entrenchment curves independently

Without at least one of these, you're asserting mechanism-braiding without evidence—you're doing what Chapter 8 warns against (using an HPC framework without confirming homeostasis).

## Summary

Your account is conceptually elegant: functional redundancy (semantic saturation) → grammatical reflex (distributional pattern) → entrenchment → apparent unity. But it rests on the acquisition claim, which is testable and currently **untested in your draft**.

I'd recommend:
1. **Mine CHILDES** for error patterns in determiner use across the three contexts
2. **Propose a comprehension experiment** (or find existing data) showing mechanism-differentiation with age
3. If both suggest mechanism-braiding, the case is much stronger

The beauty of acquisition evidence is that it can show something your final-state data cannot: the machinery of entrenchment itself.
