I write as a rhetorical economist, which is to say: sympathetic to theory, suspicious of metaphysical swagger. The chapter can argue inside linguistics by using its own evidentiary idiom—distributional facts, typological stability, acquisition trajectories—then pivoting to a different explanatory demand. You can say: yes, nouns and verbs do show cross‑linguistic stability; yes, adjectives/adverbs wobble; but the stability is not a definition, it is an effect. The essentialist default is subverted by a re-description of what counts as explanation. “Mechanism‑braiding” is not a rejection of categories; it is a proposal about why categories look stable in the first place. In McCloskeyan terms: you accept the craft norm (show me the data, show me the cross‑linguistic regularity), but you change the metaphysical warrant (from necessary‑and‑sufficient conditions to causal maintenance). The trick is to keep the internal vocabulary—HPC, projectibility, entrenchment—close enough to what linguists already use, so the move reads as a correction of method rather than a revolution against the discipline.

Where it risks sounding like a crank is where the rhetoric of subversion gets ahead of the argument. Calling “adverb” a wastebasket, or “pronoun” a pseudo‑category, can read like provocateur’s theatre unless it is immediately tied to clear diagnostics and explicit payoffs. Likewise, metaphors to biology and “architecture” can feel like borrowed authority if they are not grounded in the linguistic mechanics that readers already accept. The prophet voice is strongest where “mechanism‑braiding” earns its keep by explaining a stubborn distributional fact—e.g., determiner resistance arising by different semantic routes (deixis, anaphora, interrogative alternatives). That is a real, testable explanatory surplus. It is prophetic because it predicts convergences and divergences without stipulating them, and it normalizes variation as the signature of stability, not its negation.

To earn trust from skeptical readers, several rhetorical moves are available and should be explicit. First, show your deference: cite CGEL classifications, acknowledge the usual diagnostics, and concede the successes of orthodox analysis. Second, be scrupulously local: offer a worked example (exactly who, fused vs. integrated relatives) and show how the braided mechanisms lead to different licensing, not just different labels. Third, avoid the “everything is ill‑defined” tone; emphasize that you are tightening, not loosening, the discipline by demanding mechanisms and projectibility. Fourth, announce your limits: where the data are thin, say so. And fifth, make a modest, empirical bet: if the HPC story is right, then we should see patterned transfer in acquisition and predictable cross‑linguistic clustering. That kind of calibrated promise persuades more than metaphysical thunder.
