From a typologist's perspective, the key is to keep comparative concepts distinct from language-particular categories. HPC can help if you present it as an explanatory layer: certain comparative concepts (NOUN, VERB, PROPERTY WORD, MANNER MODIFIER) are stable because clustering is maintained by mechanisms, not because languages 'share' the same categories. That aligns with my argument that comparative concepts are researcher-defined yardsticks. The book should therefore say explicitly: HPC does not license cross-linguistic category identity, but explains why some comparative concepts are highly projectible and others are not. Add a warning against redefining comparative concepts as universal categories, and keep the diagnostics explicit and operational.

On evidence, I would want a broader typological sweep. For nouns and verbs: cite robust diagnostics across unrelated families (case/possessive marking, agreement, TAM morphology, argument-structure behavior, discourse reference vs predication) and show that even in 'flexible' languages, the distribution of these properties clusters. For adjectives: include classic cases of languages with no distinct adjective class (e.g. property words as verbs or nouns), and cases with small closed adjective classes. For adverbs: show the heterogeneity - adpositions, case-marked NPs, converbs, serial verb constructions, ideophones - illustrating the 'fat clustering' point. A few worked micro-profiles (e.g. Oceanic, Mayan, Salish, Austronesian, West African) would strengthen the claim.

On the noun/verb vs adjective asymmetry, I suggest you treat adjectives as a comparative concept for 'property-concept words' and then show why the mechanisms that stabilize N/V do not necessarily stabilize PROPERTY WORD as a distinct class. N/V track core discourse functions (reference/predication) with strong morphosyntactic reinforcement, while property words have multiple recruitment paths (verbal statives, nominal classifiers, relative clauses). The chapter can say: N/V are a tighter HPC; adjectives are looser clusters or secondary projections; adverbs are often merely functional strategies. That preserves the asymmetry without treating adjectives as failed nouns/verbs.
