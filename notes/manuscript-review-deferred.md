# Manuscript Review Notes — Parked for Future Action

**Date:** 2026-01-17  
**Status:** Parked (do not implement yet; review on next planning session)

---

## Overall Assessment

The manuscript is theoretically cohesive and the HPC framework is applied consistently. Parts I–II are polished; Part III case studies are solid (with one exception); Part IV is where the real opportunities lie.

---

## Priority 1: Chapter 14 (Grammaticality Itself) — Highest Impact

**Status:** Theoretical skeleton excellent (two-layer model, feeling-as-stabilizer, illusions, form-value table). Visibly unfinished.

**Issues:**
- Ends with `% TODO: Add HPC-kind audit for grammaticality` and `% TODO: Add \textsc{Definiteness thread} box`
- Missing proper concluding section
- No empirical grounding (unlike Ch 13, no corpus/experimental evidence)
- "Definiteness thread" box promised across chapters never appears

**What it needs:**
- [ ] Proper conclusion connecting grammaticality-as-HPC to overall argument
- [ ] Empirical anchoring: acceptability data showing variance at boundaries (satiation, individual differences, garden-path recovery)
- [ ] HPC-kind audit: run two-diagnostic test (projectibility + homeostasis) on grammaticality itself
- [ ] Integration with MMMG framework (Morphosyntactic-Meaning Model of Grammaticality)
- [ ] Section addressing Scott-Phillips 2024 on intuitions as relevance-tracking

**Confidence:** 0.95 — largest single gap

---

## Priority 2: Chapter 15 (What Changes) — Essential but Underdeveloped

**Status:** Reads as philosophical coda rather than methodological payoff. Typed parthood and subfield overlap are interesting but no concrete guidance.

**What it needs:**
- [ ] Methodological consequences section:
  - For fieldworkers: How to identify categories in underdocumented languages using two-diagnostic approach?
  - For typologists: When is cross-linguistic comparison valid?
  - For corpus annotation: How to handle boundary cases?
  - For computational modelers: What architectures respect HPC structure?
- [ ] Mereology integration from linguistics-mereology/ project
- [ ] Proper peroration returning to Huddleston's "otherwise" email from Ch 1

**Confidence:** 0.85 — needs substantial expansion

---

## Priority 3: Chapter 13 (The Category Zipper) — Strong but Under-Integrated

**Status:** Empirically richest (PHOIBLE, HistWords, construction diagnostics). Reads like standalone paper, not chapter.

**What it needs:**
- [ ] Smoother transitions between phoneme/word/construction sections
- [ ] Fuller development of stabilizer-weighting map (Table 13.1)
- [ ] Expanded predictions section (§13.7): specific experimental designs, falsification criteria
- [ ] One additional positive case (CASE or ASPECT features?)

**Confidence:** 0.75 — already strong, lower marginal returns

---

## Priority 4: Chapter 12 (Pro-form Gender) — Targeted Refinements

**Status:** Jan 8 polish made it much stronger. Hierarchy figure, inventory table, designatum analysis solid.

**Issues:**
- [ ] Epigraph (lizard tail) doesn't connect—draw link or replace
- [ ] Overlap with Ch 11 (pronouns as convergent categories): clarify division of labor
- [ ] Forward transition (§12.8) references Ch 11 as if it comes after—should point to Chs 13–15
- [ ] Empirical thinness relative to Chs 9–10: add corpus evidence for who/which distribution

**Confidence:** 0.70 — lower priority than Part IV

---

## Priority 5: Cross-Chapter Integration

**Threads set up but not delivered:**
- [ ] "Definiteness thread" boxes: Ch 5 predicts variance signatures; Ch 10 should test for weak definites
- [ ] Mechanism terminology consistency: check glossary against chapter usage ("stabilizer" vs "mechanism")
- [ ] Two-cluster pattern (form + value, coupled by inference) appears in:
  - Ch 9: individuation + count cluster
  - Ch 10: definiteness + deitality cluster  
  - Ch 12: personhood + pro-form inventory
  - **→ Deserves explicit naming as general structural insight**

## Recommended Sequence

| Priority | Task | Time Estimate |
|----------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Complete Ch 14 (conclusion, empirical, HPC audit) | 1–2 weeks |
| 2 | Expand Ch 15 (methodological consequences, close frame) | 1–2 weeks |
| 3 | Integrate Ch 13 transitions and expand predictions | 3–5 days |
| 4 | Fix Ch 12 epigraph, cross-references, forward transition | 1–2 days |
| 5 | Cross-chapter integration pass (terminology, threads) | 2–3 days |

---

## What Doesn't Need Work

- **Chapters 1–3:** Hook, essentialism critique, prototype critique all rhetorically effective
- **Chapters 4–8:** Theoretical core tight (quotatives in Ch 7, failure-modes in Ch 8)
- **Chapter 11:** Genuinely strong (anatomist's table, wastebasket/skeleton/mimics arc)
- **Chapters 9–10:** Flagship case studies; they deliver

---

## Summary

Theoretical architecture sound and consistently applied. Marginal improvement concentrated in Part IV: Ch 14 visibly incomplete, Ch 15 doesn't deliver methodological payoff. Fix those, smooth Ch 13 transitions, tighten Ch 12 loose threads → contribution will be taken seriously in philosophy of linguistics and theoretical linguistics proper.
