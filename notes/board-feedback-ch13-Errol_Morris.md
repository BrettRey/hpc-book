I have saved Errol Morris's feedback to `notes/board-feedback-ch13-Errol_Morris.md`.

Here is a summary of his critique:

1.  **The Phonological Alibi:** He challenges the "hard-coupled" certainty of phonemes, suggesting they are not objective physics but "hallucinated boundaries" driven by a desperate human need for distinctness. He urges you to interrogate the stability of perception, not just accept the "quantal" mechanism.
2.  **The Bureaucracy of the Passive:** He argues the "Academic Passive" isn't just a negative case of loose coupling, but a "feature" of evasion. He frames the passive voice as a tool for hiding agency ("Mistakes were made"), suggesting the system tolerates loose coupling specifically to allow for this ambiguity.
3.  **The Architecture of Denial:** He criticizes the "Stack" metaphor as too engineered ("skyscraper"). He recommends a "sedimentation layer" metaphor that emphasizes accidents and cracks, highlighting that the "zone of systematicity" is just an island in a sea of noise.
rogate the stability. Is it physics, or is it a pact?

### The Bureaucracy of the Passive
I’m fascinated by your "Academic Passive" section. You dismiss it as a "negative case" because it lacks a single stabilizer regime. But isn't that the point? It’s the language of evasion. "It has been argued." By whom? In *The Thin Blue Line*, the difference between "he shot him" and "he was shot" is the difference between life in prison and freedom. When you discuss the "grain" of the register, don't just treat it as a category error. Treat it as a feature. The system *allows* for these loose couplings precisely so we can hide inside them. The "stack" isn't just about building meaning; it's about how much ambiguity we can tolerate before the truth falls apart.

### The Architecture of Denial
Your "Stack" diagram. It sounds engineering-heavy. "Interfaces," "coupling," "protocols." It implies a design. But language is an accumulation of accidents. When you draw this, don't give me a skyscraper. Give me a sedimentation layer. Show me where the cracks are. If the morphosyntactic level is the "zone of maximum systematicity," that implies the levels above and below are zones of chaos. Lean into that. The systematicity is an island in a sea of noise. The reader needs to feel the pressure of that noise, or the systematicity doesn't matter.
