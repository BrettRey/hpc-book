# Board feedback (Becker) — Scott-Phillips (2025) placement

Scott-Phillips is useful to you less as “another theory to cover” than as a way to manage what the reader thinks your evidence *is*. Many readers will bring the folk picture that linguistic intuitions are a little window into “the grammar itself.” Scott-Phillips gives you a clean countermove: acceptability judgments are downstream of ordinary communicative cognition (relevance-seeking, processing cost/benefit), not privileged access to a hidden object. Used that way, it increases accessibility because it simplifies the story—*don’t treat the instrument as the thing measured*—but it can hurt accessibility if you make the reader swallow Relevance Theory machinery before they’ve even learned what problem it’s solving for your book.

So I’d treat it like a guardrail, not a detour. Give the reader a one-sentence version in the main line (“judgments track whether an utterance can plausibly be made relevant at reasonable processing cost”), cite Scott-Phillips, and keep the technical scaffolding (optimal relevance, No Synonymy, “constructions all the way down”) in a footnote or a later deep-dive. That way the citation does what citations are for in a book: it reassures the reader that you’re not making this up, without asking them to become a relevance theorist mid-chapter.

The “byproduct” framing is rhetorically strong in an HPC book because it matches your whole posture: stop looking for essences and special faculties; look for mechanisms and the side-effects they reliably throw off. The risk is tone: “byproduct” can sound like “mere illusion,” and you don’t need that fight with readers who’ve built careers on judgment data. The fix is to pair the word with respect for the method (“indirect but informative”)—or use a softer synonym in the main text (“downstream consequence,” “shadow,” “smoke”) and reserve “byproduct” for the citation/footnote where it can’t be misread as a sneer.

For chapter placement, put the *primary* citation where the reader first needs the distinction to make sense of what you’re doing: Chapter 5 (“Discrete from continuous”), in the “Gradient judgments, discrete categories” section right after you separate grammaticality from acceptability and talk about measurement channels (judgments as instruments, not the construct). That’s the moment readers are already asking “why are judgments like this?”, so Scott-Phillips reads as reader-service, not ornament. Then, if you want it to echo later, drop a brief callback in Chapter 7 when you cash out communicative/functional pressure as a stabiliser, and again in Chapter 8 when you talk about “byproducts” and smoke-ring patterns—while saving Chapter 13 (“Grammaticality itself”) for the full, explicit disentangling once that chapter exists.
