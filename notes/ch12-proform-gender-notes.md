## Core Insight from the Paper

The paper reconceptualizes English "gender" as:
1. **NOT about biological sex** as the primary distinction
2. **NOT limited to pronouns** - extends across all pro-forms
3. **Hierarchical**: PERSONAL vs NON-PERSONAL is primary; masculine/feminine is a *subcategory* of personal
4. **Designatum-driven**: Selection based on how the referent is *conceptualized*, not antecedent form

### The Hierarchy

```
PRO-FORM GENDER
├── PERSONAL
│   ├── EPICENE (I, we, you, who, singular they)
│   └── SEXUAL
│       ├── MASCULINE (he)
│       └── FEMININE (she)
└── NON-PERSONAL
    ├── GENERAL (it, which, what)
    ├── LOCATIVE (where, here, there)
    └── TEMPORAL (when, then, yesterday, tomorrow)
```

### Key Claims

1. **Personhood, not animacy**: Dogs take `it` unless personified; pets can take `who`
2. **Pro-form scope**: System includes pronouns, determinatives (-body/-one/-thing/-where), wh-words, relative pro-forms
3. **Chain coherence**: Once a designatum is construed as personal/non-personal, mixing within a reference chain is disfavored
4. **Genitive alignment**: English genitives (`her brother`) align with possessor, not head noun (cf. French `son frère`)

## HPC Architecture Parallel

### Two-Cluster Structure

Just like **countability** (Ch 9) and **definiteness** (Ch 10), pro-form gender reveals **two coupled clusters**:

| | Semantic Cluster | Morphosyntactic Cluster |
|---|---|---|
| **Ch 9** | Individuation (boundedness, atomicity) | Count (plurals, cardinals, quantifiers) |
| **Ch 10** | Definiteness (identifiability, uniqueness) | Deitality (there-resistance, partitive, hosting) |
| **Ch 12** | **Personhood** (attributed person-status) | **Pro-form inventory** (who/which, -body/-thing, he/she/it) |

### The Coupling Mechanism

- **Designatum-driven inference**: Pro-form selection is bidirectional - morphology cues conceptualization; conceptualization constrains morphology
- **Chain coherence** as maintenance: Once assigned, personhood persists through the discourse
- **Acquisition**: Children learn pro-form distributions before mastering full personhood semantics

## Chapter 12 Structural Plan

### Hook: The `it`/`she` Ship Puzzle

Traditional: "Ships are feminine in English." 
Reality: Ships are *non-personal* by default (`it`), but can be personified (`she`) - exactly what the designatum-driven account predicts.

Alternative hook: The dog puzzle - same referent, different pro-forms:
- `The dog wagged its tail` (non-personal)
- `Who's a good boy?` (personal)

### Sections

1. **The who/which puzzle**
   - Why can't `which` take human antecedents? Why can't `who` take table antecedents?
   - Violations feel *grammatical*, not just semantic
   
2. **The hierarchy revealed**
   - Personal/non-personal as primary split
   - Sexual gender as subdivision within personal
   - Temporal/locative as subdivisions within non-personal
   
3. **The designatum mechanism**
   - Conceptualization drives selection
   - Contrast with grammatical-gender languages (Spanish metonymy example)
   - English allows categorical shifts based on construal

4. **The full inventory**
   - Beyond pronouns: determinatives (-body/-one/-thing/-where)
   - Relative pro-forms (where, when)
   - The whole system, not just `he/she/it`

5. **Chain coherence**
   - The intra-chain consistency constraint
   - Degraded `which...his` examples
   - Maintenance through discourse

6. **The coupling**
   - How personhood (semantic) couples to pro-form morphology
   - Bidirectional inference parallel to countability
   - Mechanisms: acquisition, entrenchment, alignment

7. **Passing the tests**
   - Projectibility: Knowing a pro-form's gender predicts behavior
   - Homeostasis: Multiple mechanisms maintain the cluster

8. **Where the clusters slip**
   - Pets: flexible personhood attribution
   - Collectives: `team...their` vs `team...its`
   - Infants: `it` for unknown sex

9. **Looking forward**
   - Transition to Ch 13 (Lexical Categories) - bigger category, weaker coupling

## Key Differences from Existing Ch 12 Draft

The *existing* Ch 12 draft focuses on:
- Grammatical gender typology (English vs French vs German)
- The "maintenance spectrum" (transparent → arbitrary)
- Singular `they` and gender non-conforming usage

The *new* Ch 12 should focus on:
- **Pro-form gender as an HPC** (the paper's core contribution)
- **Personhood as the organizing principle**
- **The extended inventory** beyond pronouns
- **Chain coherence as a maintenance mechanism**
- **Designatum-driven selection** as the coupling

## Cross-References

- Ch 4 (Categories without essences): Personhood as flexible attribution, not essence
- Ch 7 (Stabilizers): Alignment, entrenchment as mechanisms
- Ch 9 (Countability): Parallel two-cluster architecture
- Ch 10 (Definiteness): Parallel two-cluster + decoupling architecture
- Ch 14 (Grammaticality): Violations as gradient (? vs * markings)

## Quotes to Use

> "English gender turns on personhood in grammar: who counts as a person, how personhood is signalled, and why personhood matters to grammar."

> "The personal--non-personal distinction... is made practically everywhere ('who' vs. 'what', 'somebody' vs. 'something'), even in languages where humanness isn't very prominent elsewhere in the grammar."

> "Unlike grammatical gender systems where the antecedent formally controls gender assignment, in English it's the designatum—how an entity is conceptualized—that determines gender selection."

> "English gender isn't a vestige; it's a system. It isn't scattered exceptions; it's a hierarchy."
