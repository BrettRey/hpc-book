## Core Argument

Linguistic intuitions (acceptability judgments) are NOT intuitions about grammaticality. They are **byproducts** of cognitive capacities for interpreting communicative stimuli — specifically, the presumption of optimal relevance (Relevance Theory).

Unacceptability is triggered when a sentence **logically cannot** have optimal relevance:
1. **No cognitive benefit** — unparseable (center-embedding overload)
2. **Deviation without meaning change** — extra cost, no benefit (*gived* vs *gave*)
3. **Constructional contradiction** — functions of constructions mutually incompatible

---

## Key Assumptions

1. **Constructions all the way down** — cites Goldberg, Tomasello, Bybee
2. **Optimal relevance presumption** — Sperber & Wilson's Relevance Theory
3. **Principle of No Synonymy** — no two constructions with same form have same function

## HPC Connections

### Communicative pressure as homeostatic mechanism
- Scott-Phillips argues intuitions arise from communicative function, not grammar qua grammar
- This supports HPC claim that **communicative success** is a maintenance mechanism
- Aligns with Millikan's point: linguistics has forcing function neuroscience lacks

### Acceptability vs. grammaticality dissociation
- Acceptability = intuition; grammaticality = conformity to norms
- These can dissociate — relevant for thin/fat cluster diagnostics

### Constructions as HPC kinds
- If constructions are form-function pairings maintained by communicative pressure, they are HPC kinds

## Quotable

> "Linguistic intuitions are byproduct effects of core cognitive capacities and dispositions for human ('ostensive') communication, that are themselves biological adaptations to the deeply social nature of humans' evolutionary ecology."
