## Summary

Demonstrates empirically that the *string/strung* strong verb class has exactly the structure HPC theory predicts: prototype organization, family resemblance, graded membership, no necessary/sufficient conditions — and this structure is **psychologically real** and **causally efficacious**.

## Key Findings for HPC

### 1. Family Resemblance Empirically Demonstrated
- Class isn't defined by shared features
- Members share attributes with prototype (*strung*-type: /sCC/ + /ɪ/ + velar nasal)
- *Dug* and *won* share no features with each other, yet both belong (p. 257)

### 2. Graded Membership Is Measurable
- Linear decrease in /ʌ/ past-tense responses as phonological distance from prototype increases
- Tables 10–11 quantify the gradient

### 3. Structure Predicts Historical Change
- Class expanded outward from prototype (OE had nasals; velars like *dig/dug* are later)
- Family-resemblance structure IS the mechanism of expansion

### 4. Product-Oriented Schemas
- Class defined by OUTPUT properties, not transformation rules
- HPC implication: mechanism operates on surface similarity

### 5. Cue Validity
- /ʌŋ/ almost uniquely marks past tense (p. 266)
- High cue validity = robust property clustering = natural kind status

## HPC Translation

| Bybee & Moder | HPC Framework |
|---------------|---------------|
| Family resemblance, no necessary features | Property cluster without essential properties |
| Prototype + graded membership | Central vs. peripheral instances |
| Historical expansion follows similarity | Homeostatic mechanism = analogical attraction |
| Cue validity predicts productivity | Robust clustering → inductive power |
| Psychological reality (experimental) | The kind "carves at joints" cognitively |

## What B&M Lack That HPC Provides

They have the empirical phenomenon but no explicit metaphysics of kinds:
- Don't address whether this makes the class a *natural kind*
- Don't identify *homeostatic mechanisms*
- Don't distinguish real property clusters from accidental correlations

**Your contribution:** HPC provides the philosophical scaffolding. B&M showed morphological classes have HPC structure *before* Boyd applied HPC to linguistics.

## Quotable Passages

> "Membership in morphological classes is not a matter of strict presence or absence of features, but rather of similarity to a prototype, which may be defined on a number of features." (p. 263)

> "The phonological shapes of verbs in morphological classes can be organized into natural categories, like other natural and cultural objects." (p. 251)

> "The psychological principles which govern linguistic behavior are the same as those which govern other types of human behavior." (p. 267)

## Where to Use

- **Chapter 4** — opening case study of HPC-structured category
- **Chapter 5/7** — analogical attraction as homeostatic mechanism
- **Chapter 10** — diachronic expansion follows HPC predictions
