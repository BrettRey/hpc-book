# Field-Relative Projectibility: A Core Principle

*Developed 2025-12-24 through extended conversation*

## The Central Insight

**Projectibility is field-relative.** A category projects differently depending on which analytical field is asking. What supports reliable induction for a semanticist may not support reliable induction for a syntactician — and vice versa.

This isn't perspectivalism ("different views of the same thing"). It's a claim about the ontology: **there are genuinely different HPCs** that happen to overlap in extension, each projectible in its own domain.

## The Proper Noun / Proper Name Example

| Category | Field | What Projects |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Proper name** | Semantics | unique referent, rigid designator, referential opacity |
| **Proper noun** | Syntax | heads NomP → heads NP → fills object slot → predicts case, binding |

A syntactician *knows* "Brett" is a proper name. But that fact doesn't **project** for syntax. What projects is the distributional chain.

## The Definiteness / Deitality Case (Chapter 10)

The deitality paper demonstrates this principle in action:

| Cluster | Field | Core Properties | What Projects |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Definiteness** | Semantics | identifiability, uniqueness, familiarity | reference tracking, presuppositions |
| **Deitality** | Syntax | *there*-restriction, partitive *of*, *one*-substitution | distributional behavior |

The literature's confusion (uniqueness vs. familiarity debates, "problem" of weak definites) arises from treating these as ONE category. They're two overlapping HPCs.

## The Countability Case (Chapter 9)

Same structure:

| Cluster | Field | Core Properties | What Projects |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Semantic countability** | Semantics | individuation, boundedness | distributive readings, pluralization in thought |
| **Morphosyntactic count-marking** | Syntax | plural, quantifier selection (*many* vs *much*) | distributional predictions |

*Furniture* dissociates: semantically individuated, morphosyntactically mass.

## Why This Matters

### For Part I (The Problem)
- **Essentialism fails** partly because it assumes ONE essence per category. If categories decompose into field-relative HPCs, there was never going to be a single essence.
- **Nominalism overcorrects** by saying categories are "fictions." Field-relative projectibility shows they're real — just real in different ways for different purposes.

### For Part II (The Fix)
- **Ch 6 (Projectibility)** should introduce field-relativity explicitly. It's not a complication for case studies; it's a core principle.
- **Ch 7 (Stabilisers)** Semantic and morphosyntactic clusters have different maintenance mechanisms. The coupling itself is a mechanism.
- **Ch 8 (Failure modes)** A category is "fat" for field X when it was built using criteria from field Y but is supposed to project in X.

### For Part III (Case Studies)
- **Ch 9, 10, 11, 12** all demonstrate the same pattern: grammatical categories decompose into semantic + morphosyntactic HPCs that can dissociate.

### For Part IV (Implications)
- **Ch 13 (Grammaticality)** The form-meaning pairing that CxG posits is explained: form and meaning are separate-but-coupled HPCs.
- **Ch 14 (Methodology)** Linguists should always specify which field their category projects in.

## The Three-Way Distinction

The discipline is: don't let a slogan collapse:
- **(a) Metaphysics** — what keeps tokens similar (mechanisms, Ch 4 & 7)
- **(b) Epistemology** — what lets us infer (projectibility, Ch 6)
- **(c) Pragmatics** — what classification is for (failure modes, Ch 8; methodology, Ch 14)

Field-relative projectibility is about (c): different fields have different pragmatic purposes.

## The HPC Slogan

> **"A category is a profile, stabilised by mechanisms, projectible for a purpose."**

Three-part structure mapping to three levels:
- **Profile** — the ontological surface (what you observe)
- **Stabilised by mechanisms** — the metaphysics (what maintains it)
- **Projectible for a purpose** — epistemology + pragmatics (field-relative inference)

**Why not "bet"?** The gambling register ("a bet underwritten by mechanism") foregrounds epistemic risk over homeostatic resilience, and risks sounding voluntarist. Reserve it for passages explicitly about fallibility and methodological risk.

**Anti-channel checks** (keep the three levels distinct):
1. **Cluster check:** Does property covariance hold across samples/contexts?
2. **Homeostasis check:** Can we identify perturbations where the web reconstitutes (or fails)?
3. **Projectibility check:** Are there counterfactual-supporting inferences in new contexts?

## The Book's Contribution

The field hasn't named this problem:

> Subfields share categories without recognizing that what projects for one field may not project for another. Instead of developing right-sized categories, they inherit labels and treat misalignment as "exceptions."

The book:
1. **Diagnoses** this as a pervasive confusion
2. **Provides the theoretical framework** (field-relative projectibility)
3. **Demonstrates the fix** (deitality, countability as worked examples)
4. **Offers methodology** for recognizing and addressing it
