## Summary
The logic is strong but the reader needs one visual that makes the hierarchy feel intuitive at a glance. Keep it playful but not childish; use a single clear metaphor and stick to it.

## Figure concept: the tolerance target
A simple target with rings labeled by constructions (a/an, three, many, agreement). A few nouns are placed as dots: book at the bullseye, cattle midway, furniture outside. The message: tighter constructions sit at the center; looser ones tolerate more drift.

## Alternate concept: lock panel
A lock plate with four keyholes of increasing tolerance. Keys labeled with nouns show which locks they open. This is basically your prose in one glance. If you use this, keep it monochrome and schematic (no drop shadows).

## Make the matrix friendly
The matrix is data-heavy; add a one-line caption that tells the story ("tight implies loose"). Consider light shading for the triangular region rather than extra symbols.

## Do not over-figure
One strong figure plus the matrix is enough. More will dilute the clarity.
