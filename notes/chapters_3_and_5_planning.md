# Planning Notes: Chapters 3 and 5

## Chapter 3: The Nominalist Retreat

**Core job:** Close the nominalist exit. Show that rejecting essence doesn't mean rejecting determinacy. Prevent the reader from settling for "it's all fuzzy."

### Material identified:

#### 1. Individual variation as nominalism's problem
- Essentialism predicts uniformity and fails (that's Chapter 2)
- But nominalism can't explain why there's *any* stability across speakers
- Different speakers draw boundaries differently, yet communication works
- Nominalism says "no fact of the matter"—but then why do categories persist?

#### 2. Existing non-essentialist frameworks
- Construction grammar, usage-based linguistics, exemplar theory, prototype theory
- These already reject some essentialist assumptions
- Are they nominalist? Proto-HPC? Something else?
- Position HPC relative to these: sympathetic but distinct
- Show what they get right (gradience, usage-sensitivity) and what they lack (mechanism-talk, determinacy recovery)

#### 3. Normative spillover (nominalist version)
- Essentialism underwrites prescriptivism (correct = conforming to essence)
- Nominalism underwrites relativism (no essence = no standard = anything goes)
- Both are wrong; HPC offers a third path
- Variation is real but constrained by mechanisms; not all variants are equally stable

#### 4. The inference nominalism makes
- Nominalism inherits essentialism's assumption that essence grounds determinacy
- Rejects essence, concludes determinacy fails
- Chapter 3 must show this inference is not forced
- Determinacy can be grounded otherwise (causal structure, historical facts)

#### 5. Why "it's all gradient" is not an answer
- Gradience is real but not explanatory
- Why these gradients? Why these clusters? Why stable?
- Similarity space alone can't explain typological recurrence
- Children acquire discrete-ish categories from gradient input—how?

## Chapter 5: Homeostatic Property Clusters

**Status:** DRAFTED AND REVISED (Dec 4, 2025)

**Core job:** Deliver the alternative. Show what you get in return. Make it work for linguistics.

### Revision history

- **Dec 4, 2025**: Consolidated from `drafts/chapter05_discreteness_section.tex` into `chapters/chapter05.tex`
- Implemented advisory board feedback (Boyd, Rosch, Dąbrowska, Jackendoff, Godfrey-Smith, Croft)
- Addressed Packaging Board concerns:
  - Front-loaded problem statement and answer
  - Cut defensive passages and phantom interlocutors
  - Lightened paragraph load with strategic breaks
  - Three-pass syntactic texture review (parataxis, coordination, subordination)
- Current length: 325 lines, ~46KB

### Material identified:

#### 1. What do you get in return (practical payoff)
- Boundary cases become data, not embarrassments
- Variation becomes tractable, not noise
- Diachrony becomes visible as mechanism of category maintenance
- Cross-linguistic comparison becomes empirical (which mechanisms overlap?) rather than definitional (do they fit the universal?)
- The "right analysis" question transforms: not which structure is correct, but what mechanisms are operating
- Debates about "what X really is" become empirical questions about mechanisms

#### 2. Acquisition without definitions
- Children acquire categories without being taught N&S conditions
- How? Not innateness (relocates essence to genome; doesn't explain variation)
- HPC answer: children track statistical regularities that reflect underlying mechanisms
- They acquire categories by being sensitive to the pressures that maintain them
- Empirically differentiates HPC from essentialism and nativism

#### 3. The standing-wave image
- A standing wave looks static but is dynamically maintained
- Disturb the system and the wave shifts or dissipates
- Categories as standing waves: apparent stability, ongoing maintenance, potential dissolution
- Captures: synchronic structure (there's a wave), diachronic change (wave can move), mechanism-dependence (turn off energy source, no wave), boundary gradience (fuzzy edges)
- Heuristic to think with, not a theory

#### 4. Sciences that made the shift (fuller treatment)
- Biology: species as populations maintained by mechanisms, not defined by essences
- Chemistry: elements defined by atomic number (causal-structural), not manifest properties
- The shift made these sciences *more* productive, not less
- Reassurance: abandoning definitional essentialism ≠ abandoning rigour
- How to do this for linguistics: what are the mechanisms?

#### 5. What counts as explanation
- Essentialism treats classification as explanation ("X behaves this way because it's a noun")
- This is pseudo-explanation—circular
- HPC offers causal explanation: X clusters with nouns because the same mechanisms that maintain N as a category attract X
- Mechanism-talk is harder but actually explanatory

#### 6. HPC as neo-Aristotelian
- Boyd's HPC theory sometimes called neo-Aristotelian
- Recovers real natural kinds with genuine explanatory structure
- The homeostatic mechanisms *are* the essence, causally understood
- Not anti-Aristotelian but a return to sophisticated Aristotelianism
- Chapter 2 exonerates Aristotle; Chapter 5 recovers him

#### 7. How HPC recovers determinacy
- Central theoretical point
- Determinacy grounded in causal structure, not N&S conditions
- A tiger is determinately a tiger because of lineage (causal-historical), not checklist
- Grammatical categories: membership is determinate when causal history is determinate
- Boundary cases: where causal pressures are mixed or transitional
- Indeterminacy is real but localized—not global fuzziness

#### 8. The "real structure" intuition (full redirection)
- Chapter 2 validates the intuition
- Chapter 5 redirects it: structure is real, but it's causal-historical, not definitional
- The fact of the matter is about what produced the form and how it relates to others
- Not "which definition is correct" but "what mechanisms are operating"

#### 9. The frequency–category connection
- High-frequency items grammaticalize faster
- Frequency correlates with reduction, automatization, earlier acquisition
- Why would frequency affect what essence something has? (It wouldn't.)
- HPC can say: frequency drives the mechanisms
- Category structure reflects usage because mechanisms are usage-sensitive
- Connects to usage-based frameworks but grounds them deeper

#### 10. Different categories, different ontologies
- Maybe some categories are more essentialist than others
- Closed-class items (determiners, complementizers): small, stable, listable
- Open-class items (nouns, verbs): large, shifting, gradient
- Phonological categories might be more discrete than syntactic ones
- HPC doesn't claim everything is a cluster—claims the essentialist default shouldn't be the default
- Heterogeneity is expected, not embarrassing

#### 11. Polysemy and individuation
- When is a word one item with multiple uses vs. multiple items?
- Essentialism needs a binary answer
- HPC: same or different depends on how tightly uses cluster
- *Bank* (river/financial): separate clusters, no shared mechanisms
- *Run* (move/manage): network of related uses, family resemblance
- Individuation as degree, not binary
- Connects to lexicography: dictionaries' varying sense-counts track gradient phenomena with format demanding discreteness

#### 12. Grammaticalization endpoints
- When a lexical item fully grammaticalizes, criteria snap into alignment
- Looks like essence-acquisition—crossing a threshold
- Puzzle for HPC: why do endpoints look essentialist?
- Answer: homeostatic mechanisms are attractors
- Full grammaticalization = form pulled fully into cluster
- Apparent essence is result of causal processes, not constitutive of membership

#### 13. What mechanisms specifically?
- Chapter 5 needs to name them, not just gesture
- Functional pressures (what categories are *for*)
- Acquisition pathways (how learners induce structure)
- Processing constraints (what's easy to produce/parse)
- Analogical pressure (attraction to existing patterns)
- Frequency effects (entrenchment, reduction)
- These interact; different mechanisms predominate in different cases

## Cross-chapter notes

1. **The essence/determinacy distinction** (established in Chapter 2) must be maintained throughout. Nominalism in Chapter 3 conflates them; HPC in Chapter 5 separates them.

2. **Forward pointers in Chapter 2** currently name HPC explicitly (lines 133–134, 170). These are appropriate as pointers but shouldn't do Chapter 5's work.

3. **The Aristotle thread**: Chapter 2 exonerates him; Chapter 5 recovers him. This should feel like a coherent arc, not two disconnected mentions.

4. **Diachrony** (now in Chapter 2 as killer argument) should resurface in Chapter 5 as *tractable*—HPC makes grammaticalization visible as mechanism of category maintenance.

5. **Biology parallel** appears briefly in Chapter 2. Chapter 5 could develop it more fully: what specifically did Boyd's HPC framework do for species concepts? How does the linguistic case parallel and diverge?

## Structural considerations

- **Chapter 5 scope**: ~13 subsections of material identified. Consider whether some belongs in later chapters (6-8?) or whether Chapter 5 needs internal subdivision (e.g., 5.1 "What HPC is", 5.2 "What HPC explains", 5.3 "How HPC works linguistically").

- **Chapter 3 as bridge**: Must convincingly close the nominalist exit before Chapter 5 can build the alternative. The "why is there any stability?" question is the key leverage point.

- **Positioning relative to existing frameworks**: Chapter 3 needs to show HPC isn't just construction grammar + mechanism-talk. The determinacy recovery is the distinguishing move.

- **Reframing Idea**: Frame Chapter 5 as not just "what is HPC?" but "HPC + proper functions = the full account." The synchronic clustering and the etiological explanation are two sides of one coin. If Chapter 5 carries the full HPC + teleosemantics integration, Chapter 2 needs only inoculation.

# Chapter 5 Epigraph Note

## Poem

Richard Wilbur, "Mind" (1956)

> Mind in its purest play is like some bat  
> That beats about in caverns all alone,  
> Contriving by a kind of senseless wit  
> Not to conclude against a wall of stone.
>
> It has no need to falter or explore;  
> Darkly it knows what obstacles are there,  
> And so may weave and flitter, dip and soar  
> In perfect courses through the blackest air.
>
> And has this simile a like perfection?  
> The mind is like a bat. Precisely. Save  
> That in the very happiest intellection  
> A graceful error may correct the cave.

## Rationale for inclusion

The final stanza—particularly the closing line about a graceful error correcting the cave—captures the HPC thesis: categories aren't fixed structures to be mapped but are maintained by mechanisms that can themselves shift. Usage reshapes the cluster. The cave isn't prior to the navigation.
