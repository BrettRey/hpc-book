# Board Feedback: Chapter 11 (Word Classes)
**Edward Tufte**

## The Visual Problem

Chapter 11 confronts a powerful architectural fact: nouns and verbs stabilize across languages while adjectives and adverbs fragment. The chapter must show this asymmetry without creating false visual hierarchies.

**Key principle:** Don't decorate the data. Make the asymmetry visible through minimal, comparative display.

## Figures I Would Commission

### 1. **The Stability Matrix** (not a table)
Arrange languages horizontally (20–30 sampled across families). Stack four categories vertically: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs. Use a single mark type—say, filled circles—to indicate structural prominence (e.g., dedicated morphological marking, distinct argument structure, rigid positional constraints). Leave gaps where the category is marginal or bundled with another.

*Why this works:* The eye finds the pattern instantly. Nouns and verbs form dense columns. Adjectives and adverbs scatter. No legend needed.

### 2. **The Crossover Plot**
For each language, plot noun-stability on the x-axis, adjective-stability on the y-axis. Use a 45° reference line (parity). Languages clustering *above* the line show adjective instability; *below*, noun instability (rare). Size points by language family size (optional third variable). Annotate only outliers.

*Why:* Shows deviation from expected symmetry. The cluster above the diagonal tells the story.

### 3. **Mechanism Coupling Diagram** (small-multiple view)
Six small panels, one per mechanism class (phonology contrast, syntactic distribution, morphological marking, semantic field, acquisition trajectory, sociolinguistic negotiation). For each, show as a simple two-axis scatter: how tightly noun/verb mechanisms align (x) vs. adjective/adverb mechanisms (y). Again, the asymmetry emerges from the pattern.

*Why:* Avoids the false impression that word classes are monolithic. Shows that instability isn't random—it's systematically located in weaker coupling regimes.

## Cross-Linguistic Display Pitfalls

**Avoid:**
- Stacked bar charts (they obscure proportions and flattened the variability you're trying to illuminate)
- World maps with color gradients (introduces a spurious geographic dimension)
- Tables with percentages (readers stop reading; they extract a single number and miss relationships)

**Prefer:**
- **Small multiples** (one language family = one small panel, arranged in a grid)
- **Dot-based position encoding** (position = the reader's strongest perceptual channel)
- **Absence as data** (gaps, empty cells, blank space = the category doesn't apply here)

## The Deeper Visual Task

The noun/verb–adjective/adverb contrast isn't just empirical; it's explanatory. Your figures should make visible why *mechanisms* stabilize categories unevenly. 

Show:
1. What properties cluster together (the profile)
2. What keeps them together (mechanisms)
3. Why some clusters are tighter than others (coupling strength)

One good figure beats ten decorative ones. Choose ruthlessly.
