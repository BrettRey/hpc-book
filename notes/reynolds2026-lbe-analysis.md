# Literature Analysis: Reynolds (2026) "Why English doesn't extract left branches (yet)"

**Citation:** Reynolds, B. (2026). *Why English doesn't extract left branches (yet)*. Manuscript.

## Core Argument
The paper argues that the prohibition on Left Branch Extraction (LBE) in English (e.g., **Whose did you read book?*) is not a structural constraint (like the Left Branch Condition) but an emergent equilibrium ("abstinence") resulting from:
1.  **Distributional availability of competitors:** "Workarounds" like pied-piping (*Whose book did you read?*), fused-heads (*Whose did you read?*), and *big mess* constructions (*How good a teacher*) cover the semantic space.
2.  **Psycholinguistic processing:** Fused-head productivity creates a "garden path" bias; hearing a fronted determiner commits the listener to a complete NP parse.
3.  **Bayesian Learning:** Learners receive abundant positive evidence for workarounds and zero evidence for LBE in a massive opportunity set. Absence of evidence becomes evidence of absence.

## Relevance to HPC Framework

This is a "Gold Spike" paper for the book—it provides quantitative, mechanistic backing for the anti-essentialist position.

### 1. Integration into Chapter 8 (Failure Modes)
**Fit:** The "Negative Diagnosis" failure mode.
**Argument:** LBE is the paradigmatic example of a "Negative Category" (a breakdown labeled as a rule).
-   **The Illusion:** Linguists see a consistent gap and call it a constraint ("The Left Branch Condition").
-   **The Reality:** It's a "statistical void" maintained by the crowd-out effect of competitors.
-   **Key quote:** "Abstinence, unlike impossibility, can end." (p. 2) — This is the HPC stance on conventions vs. laws.

### 2. Integration into Chapter 14 (Grammaticality Itself)
**Fit:** The definition of "Ungrammaticality" ($G(u) = 0$).
**Tension:** The paper claims LBE is "sharply unacceptable" yet purely statistical.
**Resolution:** This empirically grounds the **Entrenchment Term ($C^t(u)$)** in the MMMG model.
-   If $C^t(u)$ (community entrenchment) approaches zero for a specific configuration while remaining high for competitors, the violation feels "sharp" because the prior against it is massive.
-   **Satiation Resistance:** The paper notes LBE doesn't satiate (p. 6). This supports the claim that deep entrenchment (lifetime statistics) outweighs local exposure (lab statistics).

### 3. Integration into Chapter 13 (The Stack)
**Fit:** Coupling Strength and the "Tightness" of the Morphosyntactic Layer.
**Evidence:** The paper measures **Determiner--Head Packaging**.
-   **Metric:** $k=4$ token window.
-   **Finding:** Packaging is extremely tight; even parentheticals don't interrupt.
-   **Implication:** The semantic-morphosyntactic coupling for determiners is "High CP" (Causal Primitive) — it's a rigid, obligatory unit. The paper provides the empirical *measure* of this coupling tightness proposed in Ch 13.

## Specific Action Items

1.  **Chapter 8:** Rewrite §8.4 or add §8.5 to feature this as the "Gap vs Constraint" worked example.
2.  **Chapter 14:** Cite the "Satiation Resistance" argument (p. 6) to support the weight of Entrenchment.
3.  **Chapter 13:** Cite the "Determiner--Head Packaging" data (Section 5) as evidence for the "tight coupling" of the morphosyntactic layer.
4.  **Bibliography:** Add entry for `reynolds2026lbe`.
