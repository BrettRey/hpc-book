## Summary

Boyd would be enthusiastic about the direction but picky about inferential bridges. The chapter needs to earn its realism commitments through epistemic work.

---

## Eight Points to Address

### 1. Target Kind Triage
Make explicit whether grammatical categories are:
- Natural kinds (mind-independent)
- Human kinds (looping, socially constituted)
- Hybrid (real enough for induction, embedded enough to change)

**Sweet spot:** "Real enough to support induction, socially embedded enough to change under pressure."

**Action:** Explicit triage early in chapter.

### 2. Diagnostic Cluster vs Homeostatic Mechanisms
Keep these conceptually separate:
- The *diagnostic* cluster you use to find the kind
- The *homeostatic* mechanisms you claim stabilise it

Without separation, skeptic says "you've redescribed correlations with a causal word."

**Action:** Add "what would falsify this" paragraph.

### 3. Privileged Explanatory Question
For each level, answer:
- Which question does this level answer?
- Why is this level not decorative?

**Proposed principle:** "Depth is justified when it improves prediction, intervention, or cross-context generalisation."

**Action:** State this principle explicitly.

### 4. Realism Pledge
One tight paragraph:
- Objectively real (like biological kinds)?
- Stably discoverable (mechanisms make them reliable targets)?

Avoid slide from "mechanisms make the kind useful" → "therefore ontologically fundamental."

**Action:** Add to Commitments section.

### 5. Inflation Problem ("everything is an HPC kind")
Need discriminating negative space:
- Clear example of a category that *fails* to earn HPC status
- Why this failure matters

**Action:** Foreground failure modes earlier (Ch8 handles this, but preview needed).

### 6. Cross-Domain Transfer Payoff
One crisp sentence answering: "What does the biological HPC template let you *see* in linguistics that you couldn't otherwise see?"

**Action:** Add payoff sentence to biology section.

### 7. Moral Realism Link
If kept, use modest formulation: "This is the same *style* of realism: category realism grounded in mechanism-mediated inductive success, not definition."

**Action:** Decide whether to include; if so, keep modest.

### 8. HPC Checklist
Turn chapter into method:
1. Identify the cluster
2. Propose stabilisers at multiple scales
3. Derive intervention or natural-experiment prediction
4. Show resilience or drift under specified pressures
5. Compare to a category that does *not* behave this way

**Action:** Add checklist to robustness-tests section or create separate section.

## Priority Additions

1. **Target kind triage** — early in chapter (after intro or after "The cluster")
2. **Falsifiability paragraph** — in robustness-tests section
3. **Privileged explanatory question principle** — in multi-scale section
4. **Realism pledge** — tighten Commitments section
5. **Cross-domain payoff sentence** — in biology parallel section
6. **Failure mode preview** — foreground earlier
