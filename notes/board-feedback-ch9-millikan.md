# Board feedback (Millikan) — Chapter 9 "Countability"

In my technical framework, a mechanism possesses a **proper function** only if its current existence is a consequence of the fact that ancestors of that device successfully performed that function in the past—what I call a "Normal explanation" for its persistence. The "bidirectional inference" you describe qualifies, provided we view it as the operating principle of a cooperative signaling system that has been selected for (culturally or biologically) to facilitate coordination. The count morphosyntax (the producer) has the proper function of mapping onto individuated referents because doing so has historically allowed speakers and hearers to navigate the world successfully; the inference mechanism (the consumer side) exists because relying on these cues has historically paid off. The fact that this coupling "stabilizes" the cluster is not accidental; it is the very reason the lineage of these linguistic forms has proliferated.

Crucially, the "overgeneralization" errors you cite (e.g., *three furnitures*) are the hallmark of a device acting under its proper function. A proper function defines a norm, not a universal law; the mechanism is *supposed* to infer individuation from count syntax because that is its historically adaptive role, even when it misfires in specific cases due to lexical idiosyncrasies. The child who regularizes *cattle* or *sheep* is performing the Normal function of the language acquisition device perfectly—attempting to replicate the reproductively established family of the count category. Your "homeostasis" is effectively a description of the stabilizing function that keeps the linguistic lineage intact against the entropic drift of usage, ensuring that the sign-world mapping remains projectible enough to be learned by the next generation.
