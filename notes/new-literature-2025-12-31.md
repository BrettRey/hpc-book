# New Literature Analysis (Dec 31, 2025)

Three papers added to `literature/` with relevance to the HPC book.

---

## 1. Raviv, Meyer & Lev-Ari (2019)
**"Compositional structure can emerge without generational transmission"**  
*Cognition* 182:151–164 | DOI: 10.1016/j.cognition.2018.09.010

### Key Finding
Compositional structure emerges *within a single generation* when communities have:
- (a) multiple interaction partners
- (b) expanding meaning spaces

Challenges Kirby et al.'s claim that compositionality requires intergenerational transmission.

### HPC Book Relevance

| Chapter | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Ch 7 (Mechanisms)** | Supports *alignment* and *functional pressure* as structure-maintaining mechanisms — transmission isn't the only path |
| **Ch 13 (The Stack)** | Shows compositionality emerging from use, not inheritance |
| **Emergence paper** | Direct evidence for your commutative diagram — structure emerges from dyadic interaction |

### Key Quote
> "These findings indicate that new learners are not necessary for the formation of linguistic structure within a community" (p. 151)

## 2. Wolters, Lavi-Rotbain & Arnon (2024)
**"Zipfian distributions facilitate children's learning of novel word-referent mappings"**  
*Cognition* 253:105932 | DOI: 10.1016/j.cognition.2024.105932

### Key Finding
Skewed (Zipfian) input distributions improve learnability even when words are presented in isolation (not just cross-situational learning). High-frequency items scaffold low-frequency ones.

### HPC Book Relevance

| Chapter | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Ch 7 (Mechanisms → Acquisition)** | Explains why real-world frequency distributions *facilitate* category learning rather than impede it |
| **Ch 8 (Transmission)** | Zipfian distributions are a feature, not a bug — the input structure itself is a stabilizer |

### Key Quote
> "Children's learning was overall better in the two skewed environments, even for low frequency items" (abstract)

### Mechanism Implication
Entrenchment of high-frequency forms creates "stepping stones" for acquiring lower-frequency items. The skewed input that characterizes natural language is itself a **learning scaffold** — maintained by the same mechanisms it facilitates.

## 3. Koriat & Sorka (2017)
**"The Construction of Category Membership Judgments: Towards a Distributed Model"**  
*Handbook of Categorization in Cognitive Science* (2nd ed.), Ch 31, pp. 773–791 | DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-08-101107-2.00031-2

### Key Finding
Category membership decisions are *constructed on the fly* from sampled cues, not retrieved from fixed definitions. Confidence tracks the consistency of the cue sample, and context biases which cues are sampled.

### HPC Book Relevance

| Chapter | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Ch 4 (HPC intro)** | Direct empirical support for the HPC view — categorization is probabilistic, context-sensitive, cue-driven |
| **Ch 14 (Grammaticality)** | Confidence = consistency of sampled cues → aligns with MMMG model where acceptability judgments are gradient and constructive |

### Key Quote
> "Category membership decisions are constructed on the fly on the basis of a small set of cues sampled sequentially from a population of cues associated with the object-category item" (p. 774)

### Self-Consistency Model (SCM)
Koriat's SCM predicts:
1. Consensual responses have higher confidence and faster latency
2. Confidence predicts future consistency (same decision on re-test)
3. Context biases cue sampling → shifts both decision and confidence

This is exactly what you'd expect if categories are maintained clusters rather than fixed definitions.
