I have reviewed the draft of Chapter 13. While I appreciate the move away from essentialist definitions, the metaphor of "The Stack" flirts with a dangerous reification of the very modularity that Radical Construction Grammar rejects. By separating "Morphemes" from "Constructions" as distinct tiers, you risk implying that they are ontologically distinct components rather than points on a continuum of symbolic units. In my view, a morpheme is simply a construction with minimal internal complexity and specific phonological form. Your "stabilizer-weighting map" is a sophisticated improvement over rigid structuralist strata, but you must be careful not to present these "levels" as autonomous systems. If you treat them as independent layers rather than heuristic clusters within a unified constructional network, you undermine the continuity of form-meaning pairing that is central to your argument.

Regarding the "phoneme," I am wary of your reliance on cross-linguistic signatures to establish kindhood. You must rigorously distinguish between *descriptive categories* (which are language-specific and psychological realities for the speaker) and *comparative concepts* (which are analytical tools created by linguists). Your "field-relative projectibility" risks conflating the two. The mechanisms you cite—quantal regions and dispersion—explain why languages tend to converge on similar solutions (the comparative concept), but they do not make the English /t/ and the Spanish /t/ the same "kind." They are distinct categories defined by their opposition within specific systems. The HPC framework works best here if you strictly treat the phoneme as a language-specific HPC, acknowledging that physics acts merely as a universal constraint on the design space, not as a mechanism that creates a universal category.

However, your treatment of the negative cases is excellent and strongly aligns with the reality of linguistic variation. By correctly diagnosing "polysynthetic" as a loose typological label rather than a homeostatic kind, you validate the view that broad typological classifications are not grammatical primitives. This demonstrates that your framework has the necessary discrimination to separate genuine linguistic systems from analyst-imposed taxonomies. If you can reframe "The Stack" not as a vertical architecture of components, but as a taxonomic continuum of constructional *types* distinguished by their varying degrees of opacity and complexity, this chapter will successfully bridge the gap between cognitive reality and the mechanisms of stability.
