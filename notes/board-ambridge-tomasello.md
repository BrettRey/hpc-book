Hello, this is Mike.

Here is how I see the Ambridge piece fitting into your trajectory. Ben is pushing us to the logical extreme of the exemplar view, which is a useful corrective to the Generative assumption of "hidden structure," but biologically and developmentally, it’s too costly. The brain is an efficient organ; it doesn't just stack distinct memories like a hoarder. It compresses data. That compression *is* schematization, and that schematization creates the "stored abstractions" he's trying to deny.

**1. The Developmental Data Points to a Middle Way**
If you look at the ontogeny, children clearly start with concrete, item-based constructions—*kick the ball*, *draw a picture*. They don't have a "Transitive Subject" category yet. Ambridge is right that they rely on specific exemplars. But by age 3 or 4, the productivity is undeniable. They aren't just analogizing on the fly every single time; they have entrenched a pattern. The "radical" view ignores that **entrenchment is a form of storage**. If a neural pathway is facilitated by frequent firing, that *is* a representation. It’s not a static box, but it’s a stored potential for structure.

**2. Use Ambridge in Chapter 4 as the "Other Extreme"**
You need him in **Chapter 4** to triangulate your position.
*   *Pole A (Essentialism):* Categories are innate/definitionally bounded.
*   *Pole B (Ambridge/Radical Exemplar):* Categories are illusions/epiphenomena of ad-hoc processing.
*   *Your Position (HPC):* Categories are **real but constructed**.
Use Ambridge here to show that you don't have to be a Platonist to believe in categories. You can reject essences (with Ambridge) but still affirm the reality of the category (against Ambridge) because the *clustering is stable*.

**3. The "Mechanism" Connection (Chapter 5)**
This is where you should do the heavy lifting. In **Chapter 5**, you're talking about phase transitions and mechanisms. **Analogy is the homeostatic mechanism.**
Ambridge argues that "on-the-fly analogy" does the work. You should argue that this analogical process *is* the mechanism that maintains the cluster. When a speaker analogizes a new verb to the *subject-verb-object* pattern, they are reinforcing the cluster. The "phase transition" occurs when the pile of exemplars becomes dense enough that the child treats the pattern as a rule. That shift—from "collection of instances" to "productive schema"—is exactly the dynamic discreteness you are describing.

**My recommendation:**
Introduce him in **Chapter 4** to set up the ontological problem (Is the category real?), but reserve the detailed engagement for **Chapter 5**. There, you can argue that his "analogical generalization" is not an alternative to structure—it is the very *process* of structural maintenance.

Cheers,
Mike
