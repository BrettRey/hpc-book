# Project Log

## 5 December 2025 — Genesis of Chapter 5

### Timeline

- **October 2025**: Ord's paper comes out. Brett thinks "cool idea/tool" and writes Sorites paper despite never having written a math/logic paper. Sends to Bruno Dinis for comment. Bruno responds, but Brett has moved on; comments sit unread.
- **Saturday 29 November 2025, 8:34 PM**: HPC book folder created.
- **Wednesday 3 December 2025**: Email from Ryan Nefdt:

> Hi Brett
>
> I think this book is needed indeed! I like your use of HPC and the motivation.
>
> I just reviewed a proposal for CUP by András Kertész who argues for moderate relativism about grammatical categories as opposed to what he calls absolutism (basically your essentialism). He imports some interesting stuff from the faultless disagreement literature for some of his claims. Might want to check his p-model idea out.
>
> Of course, in philosophy, as I am sure you know, James Miller has written quite a bit on HPC as a metaphysics of words. But his linguistics is shaky though.
>
> Martin Haspelmath's work seems most relevant. He constantly makes deflationary arguments about strict categories and assumptions of discreteness in theoretical linguistics from a typological perspective. He has a chapter on this in a more philosophical vein in my forthcoming OUP handbook (I can share, if you want to see it).
>
> I have my own take on these issues. I personally favour a phase transition approach in which discreteness really is a feature of a system under a particular kind of measurement and context and continuity under a different one (like water moving from liquid to gas takes on different properties). So borrowing more from physics than biology.
>
> But your methodical and clear style should bode well for a potential book deal and be a genuine contribution to the literature!
>
> Best
> Ryan

- **Thursday 4 December 2025, ~4:15 AM**: Brett wakes thinking about phase transitions. **Ryan's email directly sparked Chapter 5** — the phase-transition framing wasn't planned and hadn't been thought through before his message. The dormant Sorites paper resurfaces as the formal backbone for the physics-to-linguistics bridge Ryan suggested. Morning: rework Sorites paper, publish on PhilPeople and arXiv. Rest of day: write what becomes Chapter 5.

### The causal chain

Ryan's email → phase-transition idea → Sorites paper as formalization → Chapter 5

This was not independent convergence. Ryan's suggestion created Chapter 5.

### Leads from Nefdt email

- [ ] **András Kertész** — CUP proposal on moderate relativism, p-model, faultless disagreement literature
- [ ] **Ryan Nefdt's phase transition approach** — asked for papers, awaiting response
- [ ] **Haspelmath chapter in OUP handbook** — Ryan offered to share

### Technical note

This book has been written with substantial assistance from LLMs (Claude Opus via Anthropic and Google's Antigravity interface). Project started 29 Nov; by 5 Dec, Chapters 1, 2, and 5 are drafted and revised. The speed is unprecedented.
