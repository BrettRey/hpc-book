# Why Semantics and Morphosyntax Couple Tightly

**Date:** December 15, 2025  
**Source:** Multi-agent exploration (Claude)

## The Observation

| Level        | Semantic coupling                                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Phonotactics | Minimal (indexical at best — dialect markers, register signals)    |
| Morphosyntax | Tight — the main event                                             |
| Discourse    | Present but diffuse — topic/focus, given/new, rhetorical relations |

**The question:** Why does the coupling peak at morphosyntax?

## Convergent Finding: OBLIGATORINESS is the Key Variable

Six independent agent explorations all converge on the same insight:

| Agent                     | Primary Finding                                        | Obligatoriness Role |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Compositional Parallelism | Parallel recursive composition creates coupling points | Morpheme is where obligatory form-meaning pairing begins |
| Timescale Alignment       | Timescale matches at phrase/clause (~300-1000ms)       | But obligatoriness trumps timescale |
| Selection Relations       | Selection IS the coupling mechanism                    | Obligatory selection → tight coupling |
| Learnability              | Four properties must converge                          | Phonology is learnable but lacks obligatory meaning |
| Zone of Systematicity     | Grammar lives where all four peak                      | Obligatoriness distinguishes grammatical from lexical |
| Prosody Test Case         | Intermediate coupling, different semantic domain       | Optional → intermediate; grammaticalized (tone) → tight |

## The Architecture

**Level 1: Below the morpheme (Phonology)**
- High systematicity in FORM (phonotactics)
- NO semantic content
- Result: No coupling possible

**Level 2: At the morpheme (Coupling boundary)**
- Saussurean arbitrariness begins
- Form–meaning pairing established
- This is where compositional parallelism starts

**Level 3: Morphosyntax (Goldilocks zone)**
- Regularity + Productivity + Obligatoriness + Learnability
- Propositional semantics (truth-conditional)
- Result: Tight coupling

**Level 4: Prosody (Parallel system)**
- Same timescale as morphosyntax
- But OPTIONAL and GRADIENT
- Pragmatic semantics (information structure, stance)
- Result: Intermediate coupling (different domain)

**Level 5: Discourse**
- Meaningful but DEFEASIBLE
- Context overrides pattern
- Result: Weak coupling

## The Refined Answer

The tight coupling isn't just "two interfaces." It's the convergence of:

1. **Compositional parallelism:** Form and meaning compose in structurally isomorphic ways
2. **Timescale alignment:** Both operate at phrase/clause level (~300-1000ms)
3. **Selection relations:** Constructions select for semantic properties, creating bidirectional inference
4. **Learnability:** Dense distributional evidence because patterns are obligatory
5. **Obligatoriness:** Must mark tense, number, definiteness — every utterance reinforces the coupling
6. **Propositional semantics:** Truth-conditional meaning requires obligatory encoding

**Phonology fails** because it lacks semantic content (nothing to couple to).

**Discourse fails** because it lacks obligatoriness (patterns are defeasible).

**Prosody is intermediate** because it's systematic but optional, and couples to pragmatic (not propositional) meaning.

## The Core Claim

> **Propositional semantics REQUIRES obligatory morphosyntactic encoding because truth-conditional meaning must be compositionally recoverable.**

If you want to assert something about the world (reference, tense, aspect, number), you need a system that:
- Forces speakers to mark the distinction (obligatory)
- Allows compositional interpretation (morpheme → phrase → clause)
- Can be learned from finite input (systematic)

Morphosyntax is where these requirements converge.

## Earlier Synthesis: The Semantic-Morphosyntactic Braid

### Agent Findings (First Round)

| Agent                | Core Finding |
|----------------------|--------------|
| A (Why Two?)         | Two-ness derives from interface constraints. The category IS the coupling, not two things braided. |
| B (Semantics Alone?) | Yes, weakly. Semantic HPCs exist pre-grammatically. Grammaticalization AMPLIFIES, doesn't create. |
| C (Volcano)          | Four filters predict grammaticalization. Dormancy is graded, not binary. Volcanoes can re-ignite. |
| D (Asymmetry)        | Unmarked poles are simpler, marked poles heterogeneous. HPC explains markedness as differential maintenance costs. |
| E (Cross-Cutting)    | Misalignment is the NORM. Alignment is the surprising phenomenon requiring explanation. |

### The Key Reframing

> **Current framing (implicit):** Semantic and morphosyntactic properties braid together to form grammatical HPCs.
>
> **Revised framing:** Semantic and morphosyntactic systems are independent oscillators. They align only when construction-mediated feedback creates phase-locking. The coupling, when it occurs, is what makes grammatical categories projectible. Cross-cutting is the base rate; alignment is the derived condition requiring specific mechanisms.

### Better Metaphors

| Metaphor                   | Captures |
|----------------------------|----------|
| Coupled oscillators        | Independence + selective phase-locking |
| Lock and key               | Fit is specific, defeasible, language-specific |
| Railway switching          | Parallel tracks, discrete coupling sites (constructions) |
| Volcanic island with coral | Historical semantic origin + synchronic formal maintenance |

## Open Research Questions

1. **Quantify coupling strength?** Mutual information between semantic and morphosyntactic properties; bidirectional conditional entropy.
2. **Do all grammatical HPCs decompose into semantic + morphosyntactic facets?** Test: find one that's purely formal or purely semantic but still projectible.
3. **What's the threshold for dormancy?** At what F1 (distributional predictability) does semantic transparency become expendable?
4. **Is the asymmetry general?** Test count/mass, definite/indefinite, tense oppositions for the same pattern as aspect.
5. **What predicts grammaticalization targets?** Four filters: cognitive salience, discourse frequency, inferential utility, structural availability.

## Integration Points in the Book

| Location               | Intervention |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Ch 6 (projectibility)  | Expand volcano section: when do volcanoes go dormant? When can they re-ignite? |
| Ch 8 (failure modes)   | Flip the cross-cutting framing. Add "alignment is the puzzle" section. |
| Ch 9 (countability)    | Foreground the two-HPC architecture as the paradigm case. |
| Ch 12 (the stack)      | Phonology lacks meaning; discourse lacks obligatoriness; morphosyntax has both. |
| Ch 13 (grammaticality) | The CxG connection: form-meaning pairing isn't primitive, it's predicted by interface coupling. Grammaticality = successful coupling at the obligatory compositional level. |
| New interlude?         | "The Two-Cable Problem" between Part II and Part III? |

## Key Revision for Ch 8

Agent B's finding challenges one claim in Chapter 8 (via Ch 9):

> **Current:** Semantic distinctions only "start to behave like kinds" after grammatical reinforcement.
>
> **Revised:** Semantic distinctions can be *weak* HPC kinds before grammatical reinforcement (individuation, factives). Grammaticalization *amplifies* and *stabilizes* the clustering; it doesn't create it from scratch.

This is consistent with the volcano metaphor: the semantic distinction is the magma; grammaticalization is the eruption that builds visible, persistent structure.
