# Morphosyntax as the Zone of Maximum Systematicity

**Date:** 2025-12-15
**Context:** Exploring why semantic-morphosyntactic coupling is tight while phonotactic and discourse coupling is weak
**Hypothesis:** Morphosyntax is where grammar LIVES—the level where systematicity peaks

---

## Executive Summary

The tight semantic-morphosyntactic coupling observed in grammatical categories (countability, definiteness, tense-aspect) is not accidental. Morphosyntax represents the **zone of maximum systematicity**—the grain where four key properties (regularity, productivity, obligatoriness, learnability) simultaneously peak. This zone sits at the interface between:

- **Too fine-grained:** Phonology has high regularity and productivity but no meaning (no semantic coupling possible)
- **Too coarse-grained:** Discourse has semantic import but low obligatoriness and high variability (coupling is defeasible)

The observation that only certain semantic distinctions get grammaticalized (tense, number, aspect, evidentiality) reflects a **filter**: semantic distinctions that can be made **obligatory** within compositional structure are those that fit the morphosyntactic zone. This explains both the tight coupling within grammar and the absence of grammaticalized "furniture" or "vehicle" categories.

**Verdict:** The "zone of maximum systematicity" hypothesis **succeeds** as an explanatory framework. It unifies observations about coupling strength, grammaticalization pathways, cross-linguistic variation, and the special status of Construction Grammar's form-meaning pairing claim.

---

## Part 1: What Is "Systematicity"?

Systematicity is not one property but a convergence of four:

### 1.1 Regularity
**Pattern repetition across instances**

- Phonology: HIGH (phonotactic rules apply consistently)
- Morphosyntax: HIGH (grammatical rules iterate across lexical items)
- Discourse: MODERATE (turn-taking conventions exist but admit exceptions)

### 1.2 Productivity
**Extension to novel cases**

- Phonology: HIGH (novel words follow phonotactic constraints: *blick* is possible, */bnick/ is not)
- Morphosyntax: HIGH (novel verbs accept tense marking, novel count nouns accept plurals)
- Discourse: MODERATE (novel contexts can require novel discourse structures; conventions guide but don't mandate)

### 1.3 Obligatoriness
**Requirement to mark the distinction**

- Phonology: N/A (phonotactics constrain form but encode no meaning)
- Morphosyntax: HIGH (English requires tense marking on finite verbs, number marking on count nouns)
- Discourse: LOW (topic continuity is pragmatically useful but linguistically optional)

### 1.4 Learnability
**Acquisition by child learners from finite input**

- Phonology: HIGH (phoneme inventories acquired by ~2 years)
- Morphosyntax: HIGH (core grammatical patterns acquired by ~5 years)
- Discourse: VARIABLE (some discourse conventions acquired early, others require explicit instruction or never fully stabilize)

### 1.5 The Convergence Point

**Morphosyntax is the only level where all four peak simultaneously.**

- Phonology lacks semantic import (no obligatoriness of *meaning*)
- Discourse lacks formal obligatoriness (patterns are defeasible, context-sensitive, genre-specific)
- Morphosyntax combines high regularity + productivity + obligatoriness + learnability **with semantic content**

This makes morphosyntax the **natural locus** for stable form-meaning coupling.

---

## Part 2: The Morphosyntax Sweet Spot

### 2.1 The Compositional Domain

Morphosyntax operates at three interlocking levels:

1. **Morpheme:** Minimal sign (form-meaning unit)
2. **Phrase:** Compositional domain (meaning assembled from parts)
3. **Clause:** Propositional domain (truthmaker, speech act carrier)

This is where:
- **Regularity is high:** Grammatical rules repeat across items (*walked, talked, jumped* all follow the same pattern)
- **Productivity is high:** Infinite sentences from finite rules (the core generative insight)
- **Obligatoriness is high:** Must mark tense in English finite clauses, must mark number on English count nouns
- **Learnability is feasible:** Children acquire it by ~5 without explicit instruction

### 2.2 Why Not Smaller Units? (Phonology)

Phonology exhibits high systematicity in **form** but not in **meaning**:

- Phonotactic rules are highly regular: English bans */bnick/, allows *blick*
- Novel words respect phonotactic constraints (productivity)
- Phoneme inventories are learned early (learnability)

**But phonemes have no meaning.** A phoneme is a contrastive unit that signals lexical identity (*pin* ≠ *pen*) but carries no semantic content itself. Therefore:

- **No semantic coupling is possible**
- Phonology is systematic about the **wrong thing** (form distribution, not meaning)
- The tight regularity exists but cannot couple to semantic categories

**Example:** The /ɪ/–/ɛ/ contrast in English:
- Highly systematic at the phonological level (maintained by perceptual magnets, lexical contrast, acquisition)
- But the contrast doesn't **mean** anything (it distinguishes *pin* from *pen* but doesn't encode individuation, definiteness, tense, aspect, or any grammatical category)
- Result: Phonology can be an HPC (Chapter 12's positive case) but cannot exhibit semantic-grammatical coupling

### 2.3 Why Not Larger Units? (Discourse)

Discourse exhibits semantic import but lacks the formal obligatoriness that creates tight coupling:

- Turn-taking conventions exist (regularity: moderate)
- Novel contexts admit novel discourse structures (productivity: moderate)
- **But discourse patterns are optional, defeasible, genre-specific** (obligatoriness: low)
- **And highly variable across contexts** (context overrides pattern)

**Examples:**

1. **Topic continuity:** Useful for coherence but not grammatically required. A speaker can shift topics abruptly without violating grammar.
2. **Register/style:** "Academic register" shows predictable patterns (avoid *gonna*, prefer heavy nominal style) but:
   - The bundle is not stable across genres, disciplines, time
   - Mechanisms are heterogeneous (schooling, gatekeeping, editorial norms, audience design)
   - Perturbation leads to rapid reweighting and partial bundle collapse (not single fraying trajectory)
   - **Verdict (from Chapter 12 planning):** "Grain problem"—ecosystem label, not single HPC at that grain
3. **Politeness/honorifics:** Mix of grammar-coded honorific morphology (often projectible within a language), register packages, and pragmatic inference. The **umbrella** term is too coarse.

**Result:** Discourse is too coarse-grained to support the tight form-meaning coupling that morphosyntax exhibits. Patterns exist but are **defeasible and context-sensitive**, not **obligatory and compositional**.

---

## Part 3: The Grammaticalization Filter

### 3.1 Obligatoriness as the Key Variable

A core observation from typology and grammaticalization:

- **Some semantic distinctions get grammaticalized:** tense, aspect, number, definiteness, evidentiality, person, gender, case
- **Other semantic distinctions never do:** furniture, vehicles, color, size (as obligatory grammatical categories)

**Why?**

The grammaticalization filter selects for semantic distinctions that:
1. **Can be made obligatory** in morphosyntactic encoding
2. **Fit compositional structure** (apply at morpheme, phrase, or clause level)
3. **Are learnable from distributional evidence** (children can acquire them without explicit instruction)
4. **Are communicatively frequent/useful enough to stabilize**

### 3.2 What Gets Grammaticalized

| Semantic domain | Grammaticalized in many languages? | Why? |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|------|
| **Tense** | Yes | Temporal reference is obligatory for finite clauses in many languages; compositionally integrated |
| **Aspect** | Yes | Event structure is obligatory in verb semantics; integrates with tense |
| **Number** | Yes | Individuation/plurality is obligatory for count nouns; compositionally integrated |
| **Definiteness** | Yes | Referential status is obligatory for nominals in many languages |
| **Evidentiality** | Yes (some langs) | Source of information can be obligatory in some systems (Turkish, Japanese) |
| **Person** | Yes | Participant structure obligatory in finite clauses |
| **Furniture** | No | Conceptual category; no compositional integration point |
| **Vehicles** | No | Conceptual category; no compositional integration point |
| **Color** | No (except rare cases) | Perceptual category; occasional adjectival/derivational morphology but not obligatory |

### 3.3 The Obligatoriness Constraint

**Key insight:** Only semantic distinctions that can be **forced into obligatory morphosyntactic marking** get grammaticalized.

- English **requires** tense marking on finite verbs (*walked* vs *walk* vs *will walk*)
- English **requires** number marking on count nouns (*dog* vs *dogs*)
- English **does not require** marking whether the referent is furniture, a vehicle, or food

Why? Because **furniture** is:
1. Not compositionally integrated (no grammatical slot demands it)
2. Not semantically obligatory (you can refer to chairs without marking "furniturehood")
3. Not learnable from distributional morphosyntax (it's a lexical-conceptual category)

**Result:** Furniture exhibits conceptual clustering (chairs and tables share properties) but **lacks morphosyntactic reinforcement**. There's no grammatical frame that says "furniture-like things go here" (Chapter 9's contrast with countability).

### 3.4 The Coupling Mechanism

From Chapter 9's analysis of countability:

> "Countability operates at the syntax-semantics interface. The individuation cluster is reinforced by perceptual mechanisms (edge detection, object files, cross-modal integration). The count cluster is reinforced by morphosyntactic mechanisms (acquisition, entrenchment, transmission). But the coupling between them—the bidirectional inference mechanism—provides a third layer of reinforcement."

**Why countability is different from furniture:**

- **Furniture:** Conceptual similarity exists (chairs and tables share properties) but English provides **no morphosyntactic system that selects for that similarity and reinforces it with every utterance**. The category exists in the lexicon but not in the grammar.
- **Countability:** The grammar provides **slots that select for individuation**: *a* requires atomic reference; *three* requires enumerable atoms; *many* tolerates weaker individuation. Every time a speaker uses these constructions, they reinforce the link between semantic construal and grammatical form.

**This is the zone of maximum systematicity in action:**

1. The semantic distinction (individuation) **can be made obligatory** (English count syntax requires it)
2. The morphosyntactic forms (articles, numerals, plural marking) **are highly systematic** (regular, productive, learnable)
3. The **coupling mechanism** (bidirectional inference) operates at multiple timescales:
   - Processing (milliseconds): form primes meaning, meaning primes form
   - Acquisition (years): children learn that count morphosyntax correlates with individuation
   - Transmission (decades): institutional forces stabilize canonical patterns

**Result:** Tight semantic-morphosyntactic coupling producing an HPC kind.

---

## Part 4: Cross-Linguistic Evidence

### 4.1 The Prediction

If morphosyntax is the zone of maximum systematicity, we predict:

1. **Languages with more grammaticalized distinctions** (richer morphology) should show **tighter coupling** between semantic and morphosyntactic properties
2. **Languages with fewer grammaticalized distinctions** (isolating languages) should show the **same semantic distinctions expressed lexically or pragmatically** (looser coupling)

### 4.2 Evidence: Tense and Aspect

**Rich morphology (e.g., Polish):**
- Aspect is obligatorily marked on verbs (perfective vs imperfective)
- Tight coupling: ~90% of verbs prefer one aspect (Chapter 6's data)
- Conditional probability high: F1(aspect|tense) ≈ 0.95, F1(tense|aspect) ≈ 0.90

**Sparse morphology (e.g., Mandarin Chinese):**
- Aspect is marked by free morphemes (*le, guo, zhe*) but **not obligatory**
- Same semantic distinctions exist (completed vs ongoing events) but expressed **lexically and contextually**
- Looser coupling: aspect marking is optional, context-dependent

**Prediction confirmed:** Obligatory morphosyntactic marking creates tighter clustering than optional/lexical marking.

### 4.3 Evidence: Evidentiality

**Obligatory evidential systems (e.g., Turkish, Japanese):**
- Evidentiality is grammaticalized (direct vs indirect evidence marked on verbs)
- Tight coupling between semantic source-of-knowledge and morphosyntactic marking
- Highly projectible: knowing the context predicts the morphology; knowing the morphology predicts epistemic status

**No evidential system (e.g., English):**
- Same semantic distinctions exist (speakers track source of knowledge)
- But expressed **lexically** (*I saw X* vs *I heard that X* vs *apparently X*)
- Looser coupling: no obligatory morphosyntactic marking
- More variable expression strategies

**Prediction confirmed:** Grammaticalization of a semantic distinction into obligatory morphosyntax creates tighter systematicity than lexical expression.

### 4.4 Evidence: Number and Definiteness

**Cross-linguistic patterns:**
- Languages with obligatory number marking (English, Spanish, etc.): tight coupling between individuation semantics and count morphosyntax
- Languages without obligatory number marking (Mandarin, Japanese): same semantic distinctions but looser coupling (expressed via classifiers, context, lexical modifiers)
- Languages with obligatory definiteness marking (English, Arabic): tight coupling between referential status and article use
- Languages without obligatory definiteness marking (Russian, Mandarin): same semantic distinctions but looser coupling

**General pattern:** Obligatory grammatical marking → tight systematicity → strong HPC candidacy

## Part 5: Construction Grammar Connection

### 5.1 Form-Meaning Pairing as Structural Necessity

Construction Grammar's foundational claim: **constructions are form-meaning pairings**.

From the CxG notes:
> "The form-meaning pairing thesis is largely **definitional** at its core but supported by parsimony arguments... However, **philosophical derivation is largely absent**."

**HPC analysis offers the missing derivation:**

If grammatical categories are HPCs maintained by coupling mechanisms, and if morphosyntax is the zone where systematicity peaks, then **form-meaning pairing is not a stipulation but a structural necessity**:

1. **Form (morphosyntax) is where systematicity lives:** regularity + productivity + obligatoriness + learnability all peak here
2. **Meaning (semantics) is what gets systematized:** the semantic distinctions that fit obligatory morphosyntactic encoding
3. **The coupling (bidirectional inference) is what creates the HPC:** neither form nor meaning alone generates the tight clustering; the **interface** does

**Result:** Grammatical HPCs **must** decompose into:
- A **semantic cluster** (individuation, definiteness, temporal reference, etc.)
- A **morphosyntactic cluster** (count morphology, articles, tense morphology, etc.)
- A **coupling mechanism** (bidirectional inference at multiple timescales)

This is not a contingent pattern. It's what you get when you ask: "What kind of category structure emerges at the interface where obligatory compositional form meets obligatory semantic content?"

### 5.2 Why Two Clusters?

From project log (2025-12-13):
> "If grammatical HPCs typically decompose into semantic + morphosyntactic clusters at finer grain (as countability does), this echoes CxG's claim that constructions are form-meaning pairings. Grammaticality itself may be maintained by this dual structure—not a contingent pattern but a principled necessity."

**The HPC architecture explains the duality:**

- **Semantic cluster:** Maintained by perceptual/conceptual mechanisms (edge detection for individuation, temporal cognition for tense, theory-of-mind for evidentiality)
- **Morphosyntactic cluster:** Maintained by grammatical mechanisms (acquisition, entrenchment, transmission, paradigmatic pressure)
- **Coupling:** Maintained by interface mechanisms (processing alignment, acquisition correlation, communicative reinforcement)

**Why not one unified cluster?**

Because the **mechanisms are distinct**:
- Individuation (semantic) is maintained by perceptual systems, conceptual structure, cross-modal integration
- Count morphology (morphosyntactic) is maintained by distributional learning, paradigmatic analogy, frequency entrenchment
- The **coupling** is what creates a grammatical category from two independently maintained clusters

**Analogy (from Chapter 9):**
> "Think of it this way. Each count construction—*a* N, *three* N, *many* N—is a lock with a specific tolerance. The noun provides a key: its individuation profile. If the key clears the tolerance, the construction is licensed."

The lock is morphosyntactic (maintained by grammatical mechanisms). The key is semantic (maintained by conceptual mechanisms). The **fit** is the coupling (maintained by interface mechanisms). All three are necessary; none is sufficient alone.

### 5.3 Grammaticality as Form-Meaning Success

From oconnor-and-hpc-levels.md:
> "The model locates grammaticality at *individual form-meaning pairings*. That's where the HPC is. 'English morphosyntax' and 'English morphosyntactic meaning' are abstractions over many such pairings—useful taxonomic categories without the mechanism-maintained unity HPCs require."

**Implication:** A sentence is grammatical when:
1. Morphosyntactic form M(u) successfully evokes meaning μ(u)
2. Meaning is compatible with semantic-pragmatic context (K ≈ 1)
3. The pairing is entrenched in the community (C^t above threshold)
4. Entrenchment is maintained by identifiable forces (frequency, noise detection, prestige, analogy)

**This is zone-of-maximum-systematicity at the clausal level:**
- The form is systematic (compositional, productive, learnable)
- The meaning is systematic (compositional, truth-conditional, context-appropriate)
- The coupling is systematic (processing-aligned, acquisition-driven, community-maintained)

---

## Part 6: Why Phonology and Discourse Fail to Couple

### 6.1 Phonology: Systematic Form Without Meaning

**What phonology has:**
- High regularity (phonotactic rules apply consistently)
- High productivity (novel words follow constraints)
- High learnability (acquired early)

**What phonology lacks:**
- **Semantic content at the unit level**

A phoneme is a **contrastive unit**, not a **meaningful unit**:
- /p/ vs /b/ distinguishes *pin* from *bin* but neither phoneme **means** anything
- Phonotactic constraints organize **sound sequences**, not **meaning structures**
- Result: No semantic cluster to couple to morphosyntactic cluster

**Example from Chapter 12 planning:**

The /ɪ/–/ɛ/ contrast (pin vs pen):
- Positive HPC case: maintained by perceptual magnets, lexical contrast, acquisition, transmission
- But: **It's a phonological HPC, not a grammatical HPC**
- The contrast doesn't encode individuation, definiteness, tense, or any grammatical category
- It exists at the **wrong grain** for semantic-grammatical coupling

**Conclusion:** Phonology is systematic but **orthogonal** to the semantic-grammatical coupling that defines grammatical categories.

### 6.2 Discourse: Meaningful Patterns Without Obligatoriness

**What discourse has:**
- Semantic import (topic continuity, politeness, register all **mean** something)
- Some regularity (turn-taking conventions, coherence principles)
- Some productivity (novel contexts admit novel structures)

**What discourse lacks:**
- **Obligatoriness:** Discourse patterns are defeasible, context-sensitive, genre-specific
- **Tight formal encoding:** No grammatical slot **requires** marking topic shift or politeness level (in most languages)
- **Stable clustering:** Perturbation (platform shift, community change) leads to rapid reweighting and partial bundle collapse

**Examples:**

1. **Register (academic vs casual):**
   - From Chapter 12: "At book-level grain it's plausibly an *ecosystem label*: a moving bundle of norms, genres, and discipline-specific conventions"
   - High projectibility (you can predict academic style) but **messy ontology** (heterogeneous mechanisms)
   - **Grain problem:** Macro-label is too coarse; finer-grained units (specific constructions, formulaic sequences) may recover HPC status

2. **Politeness/honorifics:**
   - Mix of grammar-coded honorific morphology (language-internal, often projectible), register packages, and pragmatic inference
   - The **umbrella** term bundles things that can come apart
   - Korean honorifics (grammaticalized morphology): plausibly an HPC
   - "Politeness register" (cross-linguistic pragmatic category): too fat, ecosystem label

**Conclusion:** Discourse exhibits meaningful patterns but lacks the **obligatory formal encoding** that creates tight systematicity. Patterns exist but are **too defeasible** to generate the morphosyntax-level coupling.

### 6.3 Summary Table

| Level | Regularity | Productivity | Obligatoriness | Learnability | Semantic content | Coupling potential |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Phonology** | High | High | N/A (form only) | High | **None** (contrastive, not meaningful) | **No** (nothing to couple to) |
| **Morphosyntax** | High | High | **High** | High | **Yes** (compositional meaning) | **Yes** (zone of maximum systematicity) |
| **Discourse** | Moderate | Moderate | **Low** (defeasible) | Variable | **Yes** (pragmatic meaning) | **Weak** (too optional, too variable) |

## Part 7: Empirical Predictions and Tests

### 7.1 Prediction 1: Grammaticalization Targets

**Prediction:** Semantic distinctions that get grammaticalized will be those that:
1. Can be made obligatory at morpheme/phrase/clause level
2. Are communicatively frequent enough to stabilize
3. Fit compositional structure (apply recursively across lexical items)

**Test:** Survey of grammaticalization pathways across languages should show:
- Tense, aspect, number, definiteness, person, case, evidentiality: **commonly grammaticalized**
- Furniture, vehicles, color, food categories: **never grammaticalized** as obligatory morphosyntax
- Spatial relations, temporal relations: **grammaticalized as adpositions/case** (intermediate systematicity)

**Status:** Confirmed by existing typological literature (Bybee, Heine & Kuteva, Haspelmath).

### 7.2 Prediction 2: Morphological Richness → Tighter Coupling

**Prediction:** Languages with richer morphology (more grammaticalized distinctions) will show tighter semantic-morphosyntactic coupling than isolating languages.

**Test:** Compare:
- **Rich morphology (e.g., Polish, Turkish):** High conditional probabilities between semantic features and morphological marking
- **Isolating morphology (e.g., Mandarin, Vietnamese):** Same semantic distinctions but looser coupling (more lexical/contextual expression)

**Status:** Partially confirmed by existing studies (Polish aspect data from Ch 6; evidentiality studies). More systematic cross-linguistic comparison needed.

### 7.3 Prediction 3: Acquisition Order

**Prediction:** Children should acquire obligatory morphosyntactic distinctions **before** optional/discourse-level distinctions of comparable semantic complexity.

**Test:** Compare acquisition timelines:
- **Obligatory morphosyntax:** Tense marking, plural marking, article use (acquired by ~3-5 years)
- **Discourse patterns:** Topic continuity, register variation, politeness strategies (acquired later, some never fully stabilize)

**Status:** Confirmed by acquisition literature (Tomasello, Bybee, Slobin).

### 7.4 Prediction 4: Processing Costs

**Prediction:** Violations of obligatory morphosyntactic patterns should incur higher processing costs than violations of discourse-level patterns.

**Test:** Compare processing costs (reading times, ERP responses):
- **Morphosyntactic violations:** *\*The dog bark* (agreement), *\*Three furniture* (countability)
- **Discourse violations:** Abrupt topic shift, register mismatch

**Expected result:** Morphosyntactic violations should show:
- Earlier and larger N400/P600 effects (semantic/syntactic integration difficulty)
- Longer reading times
- Lower acceptability ratings

**Status:** Partially confirmed by existing psycholinguistic work. Discourse violations show effects but typically **later and smaller** than morphosyntactic violations.

### 7.5 Prediction 5: Diachronic Stability

**Prediction:** Grammaticalized distinctions (obligatory morphosyntax) should be **more diachronically stable** than lexical or discourse-level expressions of the same semantic content.

**Test:** Track diachronic change in:
- **Grammaticalized tense/aspect systems:** Should show slow, conservative change (e.g., Polish aspect stability over centuries)
- **Lexical tense/aspect markers:** Should show faster replacement rates (e.g., English *gonna* replacing *going to*)
- **Discourse conventions:** Should show rapid change (e.g., quotative *be like* replacing *say* in 20 years)

**Status:** Confirmed by historical linguistics (grammaticalization creates stability; see Bybee 2010, Heine & Kuteva 2002).

---

## Part 8: Theoretical Implications

### 8.1 Why Morphosyntax Is Special

**It's not arbitrary that grammatical categories live at the morpheme-phrase-clause level.**

Morphosyntax is where:
1. **Form is systematic enough** to support obligatory, productive, learnable patterns
2. **Meaning is compositional enough** to integrate with syntax
3. **Coupling is tight enough** to create stable form-meaning pairings
4. **All four systematicity properties peak simultaneously**

**Result:** Morphosyntax is the **natural locus** for grammatical categories. Not by stipulation, but by architectural necessity.

### 8.2 The Interface as Explanatory Locus

**Key insight:** Grammatical categories don't live in semantics or morphosyntax **alone**. They live at the **interface**.

- **Countability** is not purely semantic (individuation) or purely morphosyntactic (count morphology)—it's the **coupling** of the two
- **Definiteness** is not purely semantic (referential status) or purely morphosyntactic (article use)—it's the **coupling**
- **Tense** is not purely semantic (temporal reference) or purely morphosyntactic (inflectional marking)—it's the **coupling**

**This resolves a long-standing tension in linguistics:**

- **Generativists** focus on the morphosyntactic cluster (formal systematicity)
- **Functionalists** focus on the semantic cluster (communicative function)
- **Both are right:** The category is maintained by **both clusters plus their coupling**

**HPC framework:** The category is the **tripartite structure**:
1. Semantic cluster + mechanisms
2. Morphosyntactic cluster + mechanisms
3. Coupling mechanism (bidirectional inference at multiple timescales)

### 8.3 Construction Grammar Vindicated (and Explained)

**CxG's central claim:** Constructions are form-meaning pairings.

**HPC analysis:** This is not a stipulation but a **structural consequence** of where grammar lives.

**Why form-meaning pairings?**

Because grammatical categories emerge at the interface where:
- **Obligatory compositional form** (morphosyntax) meets
- **Obligatory semantic content** (compositional meaning)

**Why "all the way down"?**

Because the same architecture applies at every grain:
- **Morpheme:** Minimal form-meaning pairing (e.g., plural *-s* = [+plural])
- **Construction:** Multi-unit form-meaning pairing (e.g., ditransitive = [X causes Y to receive Z])
- **Clause:** Propositional form-meaning pairing (e.g., interrogative syntax = [request for information])

**Why no lexicon/grammar distinction?**

Because the **coupling mechanism** (bidirectional inference, acquisition correlation, entrenchment) applies to:
- **Lexical items:** High-frequency chunks (*gonna*, *a lot of*) become entrenched units
- **Productive patterns:** Low-frequency constructions (ditransitive with novel verbs) generalize via analogy

**HPC contribution:** Explains **why** CxG's foundational claims work:
- Form-meaning pairing is where morphosyntactic systematicity couples to semantic systematicity
- The continuum (lexicon → grammar) reflects **degrees of entrenchment and productivity**, not categorical difference
- The uniformity ("all the way down") reflects **scale-invariant coupling mechanisms**

---

## Part 9: Limitations and Boundary Cases

### 9.1 Non-Obligatory Grammatical Patterns

**Challenge:** Some grammatical patterns are **productive and systematic** but **not obligatory**.

**Examples:**
- **English *be like* quotative:** Highly systematic within young speakers, but optional (can use *say* instead)
- **English genitive alternation:** Both *the dog's tail* and *the tail of the dog* are grammatical; choice is discourse-conditioned

**Response:** These are **intermediate cases** on the obligatoriness scale:
- High systematicity (regular, productive, learnable)
- But lower obligatoriness than tense/number
- Result: **Looser coupling**, still HPC candidates but with weaker homeostasis

**Prediction:** Should show:
- More variability (individual differences, register differences, diachronic change)
- Weaker projectibility (harder to predict from context)
- More genre/register sensitivity

**Status:** Confirmed by Chapter 7's quotative case study—maintained by braided mechanisms including social indexing, not just grammatical obligatoriness.

### 9.2 Highly Obligatory Non-Grammatical Patterns

**Challenge:** Some **non-grammatical** patterns exhibit high obligatoriness.

**Examples:**
- **Phonotactic constraints:** English bans word-initial /ŋ/—highly obligatory, but no semantic content
- **Prosodic constraints:** Stress patterns, intonation contours—systematic and partly obligatory

**Response:** These exhibit **form-side systematicity without semantic coupling**:
- Phonotactics: systematic form, no meaning → no coupling possible
- Prosody: systematic form, some meaning (focus, information structure) → **borderline case**

**Prosody as intermediate case:**
- Some prosodic patterns encode grammatical meaning (e.g., question intonation, focus marking)
- But coupling is **looser** than morphosyntactic marking (more variability, less obligatory)
- Result: **Prosody sits at the boundary** between phonology and morphosyntax

### 9.3 Cross-Linguistic Variation in Obligatoriness

**Challenge:** What's obligatory in one language is optional in another.

**Examples:**
- **Evidentiality:** Obligatory in Turkish/Japanese, optional (lexical) in English
- **Numeral classifiers:** Obligatory in Mandarin/Japanese, absent in English
- **Tense:** Obligatory in English, optional in Mandarin

**Response:** This **supports** the zone-of-maximum-systematicity hypothesis:

**Languages differ in what distinctions they grammaticalize:**
- Turkish grammaticalizes evidentiality → tight coupling in Turkish, loose in English
- Mandarin grammaticalizes classifiers → tight coupling in Mandarin, absent in English
- English grammaticalizes tense → tight coupling in English, looser in Mandarin

**But the pattern is consistent:** Grammaticalization → obligatory morphosyntax → tight coupling → strong HPC.

**Prediction:** For any semantic distinction:
- **Grammaticalized** (obligatory morphosyntax) → tight coupling, strong projectibility
- **Lexical** (optional marking) → loose coupling, weak projectibility
- **Absent** (not encoded) → no coupling

**Status:** Confirmed by cross-linguistic studies of tense/aspect (Bybee, Dahl), evidentiality (Aikhenvald), number (Corbett).

## Part 10: Final Verdict

### 10.1 Does "Zone of Maximum Systematicity" Explain the Coupling?

**Yes.**

The tight semantic-morphosyntactic coupling observed in grammatical categories is explained by:
1. **Morphosyntax is where all four systematicity properties peak:** regularity, productivity, obligatoriness, learnability
2. **This creates the conditions for tight form-meaning coupling:** obligatory, compositional, learnable patterns
3. **Phonology lacks semantic content:** high systematicity but nothing to couple to
4. **Discourse lacks obligatoriness:** semantic content but too defeasible/variable for tight coupling

### 10.2 What Makes Morphosyntax the Systematic Level?

**Convergence of architectural properties:**

1. **Compositional structure:** Meaning built from parts (morpheme → phrase → clause)
2. **Obligatory marking:** Languages require speakers to mark certain distinctions (tense, number, etc.)
3. **Distributional regularity:** Patterns repeat across lexical items, enabling learning
4. **Productive generalization:** Novel items fit existing patterns (novel verbs take tense, novel count nouns take plurals)

**This is not accidental.** It's what you get when you ask: "At what grain do formal patterns become both **obligatory enough to be systematic** and **meaningful enough to be communicative**?"

**Answer:** The morpheme-phrase-clause level. Smaller (phonology) is too fine-grained (no meaning). Larger (discourse) is too coarse-grained (no obligatoriness).

### 10.3 The Role of Obligatoriness

**Obligatoriness is the critical variable that distinguishes grammatical from lexical/discourse patterns.**

**Grammaticalized (obligatory):**
- Tense in English finite verbs
- Number on English count nouns
- Evidentiality in Turkish verbs
- Classifiers in Mandarin nouns

**Result:** Tight coupling, high projectibility, strong HPC candidacy.

**Lexical/optional:**
- Aspect in Mandarin (*le, guo, zhe*—optional)
- Evidentiality in English (*I saw* vs *I heard*—lexical)
- Topic marking in English—discourse-level, optional

**Result:** Looser coupling, weaker projectibility, weaker HPC candidacy.

**Why obligatoriness matters:**

1. **Forces usage:** Every utterance activates the coupling (processing reinforcement)
2. **Ensures exposure:** Learners encounter the pattern in every relevant context (acquisition)
3. **Resists drift:** Obligatory patterns are harder to lose (diachronic stability)
4. **Creates expectation:** Violations incur processing costs (grammaticality judgments)

### 10.4 What This Predicts About Cross-Linguistic Variation

**Prediction 1:** Languages grammaticalize different semantic distinctions → different coupling patterns.
- **Confirmed:** Evidentiality (Turkish vs English), classifiers (Mandarin vs English), aspect (Slavic vs Germanic)

**Prediction 2:** Within a language, grammaticalized distinctions show tighter coupling than lexical ones.
- **Confirmed:** English tense (grammaticalized) vs English evidentiality (lexical)

**Prediction 3:** Diachronic grammaticalization creates increasing systematicity.
- **Confirmed:** *will* grammaticalization (Ch 7): volition → futurity → auxiliary, acquiring obligatory morphosyntax and shedding lexical variability

**Prediction 4:** Semantic distinctions that **cannot be made obligatory at morpheme/phrase/clause level** will never grammaticalize.
- **Confirmed:** Furniture, vehicles, color categories remain lexical-conceptual, never become obligatory grammatical categories

### 10.5 Implications for the Book

**For Chapter 7 (Homeostasis):**
- Mechanisms operate at multiple timescales **because morphosyntax is where systematicity lives**
- Processing, acquisition, entrenchment, transmission all reinforce the same patterns **because they're obligatory and compositional**
- The braided mechanisms (cognitive + social + structural) work **because the zone admits all three**

**For Chapter 9 (Countability):**
- The tight coupling between individuation (semantic) and count morphology (morphosyntactic) is **not coincidental**
- It reflects the **zone-of-maximum-systematicity architecture**
- Furniture fails because it lacks morphosyntactic reinforcement (**no obligatory slot**)

**For Chapter 12 (The Stack):**
- Phonology is systematic but **orthogonal** (wrong grain for semantic coupling)
- Discourse is meaningful but **too defeasible** (wrong grain for obligatory coupling)
- Morphosyntax is the **Goldilocks zone** (just right for form-meaning HPCs)

**For Chapter 13 (Grammaticality):**
- Grammaticality is **form-meaning coupling success** at the zone of maximum systematicity
- A sentence is grammatical when morphosyntactic form successfully evokes compositional meaning **within the systematic, obligatory, learnable patterns of the language**
- This explains why grammaticality judgments are:
  - **Gradient** (coupling strength varies)
  - **Context-sensitive** (discourse/pragmatic factors modulate)
  - **Stable** (homeostatic mechanisms maintain core patterns)

## Part 11: Open Questions and Further Research

### 11.1 Prosody as Boundary Case

**Question:** Where does prosody fit?

**Status:**
- Some prosodic patterns encode grammatical meaning (question intonation, focus marking)
- But coupling is **looser** than morphosyntactic marking (more variability, cross-linguistic diversity)
- Prosody may sit **at the boundary** between phonology and morphosyntax

**Research needed:** Systematic comparison of prosodic patterns across languages to assess:
- Obligatoriness (do languages require prosodic marking of focus/topic?)
- Projectibility (how well do prosodic cues predict semantic/pragmatic meaning?)
- Homeostasis (what mechanisms maintain prosodic patterns?)

### 11.2 Classifier Systems

**Question:** Do classifier systems (Mandarin, Japanese) exhibit the same tight coupling as morphological number systems (English, Spanish)?

**Hypothesis:** Yes, because classifiers are **obligatory morphosyntax** in those languages.

**Prediction:**
- Mandarin classifiers should show tight coupling between individuation semantics and classifier choice
- High projectibility (knowing the noun predicts the classifier; knowing the classifier constrains noun semantics)
- Maintained by acquisition, entrenchment, transmission (same mechanisms as English count morphology)

**Research needed:** Systematic comparison of classifier systems and morphological number systems using HPC diagnostics.

### 11.3 Signed Languages

**Question:** Do signed languages exhibit the same zone-of-maximum-systematicity architecture?

**Hypothesis:** Yes, but with modality-specific morphosyntax.

**Prediction:**
- Signed languages should grammaticalize the same semantic distinctions (tense, aspect, number, person) but in **spatial/gestural morphosyntax**
- Tight coupling should exist between semantic content and manual/non-manual morphosyntactic marking
- Same obligatoriness, systematicity, learnability patterns

**Research needed:** Application of HPC framework to signed language categories (in progress in broader field but not yet integrated into book).

### 11.4 Intermediate Cases

**Question:** How do we analyze patterns that are **systematic but not obligatory** (e.g., genitive alternation, quotative variation)?

**Hypothesis:** These are **intermediate cases** on the systematicity spectrum:
- High regularity and productivity
- But lower obligatoriness than core grammatical patterns
- Result: **Looser coupling, weaker homeostasis**

**Prediction:**
- Should show more individual/register/diachronic variability
- Should be more sensitive to discourse/pragmatic factors
- Should have intermediate projectibility scores

**Research needed:** Systematic study of non-obligatory grammatical patterns using HPC diagnostics to map the **systematicity gradient**.

## Conclusion

The **zone of maximum systematicity** hypothesis succeeds as an explanatory framework for why semantic-morphosyntactic coupling is tight in grammatical categories.

**Core claims validated:**

1. **Morphosyntax is where systematicity peaks:** All four properties (regularity, productivity, obligatoriness, learnability) converge at the morpheme-phrase-clause level.

2. **Obligatoriness is the key variable:** Semantic distinctions that can be made obligatory in morphosyntactic encoding are those that get grammaticalized and exhibit tight coupling.

3. **Phonology is too fine-grained:** High systematicity but no semantic content → no coupling possible.

4. **Discourse is too coarse-grained:** Semantic content but low obligatoriness and high variability → coupling is defeasible.

5. **Form-meaning pairing is structurally necessary:** Grammatical categories emerge at the interface where obligatory compositional form meets obligatory semantic content—this is not a stipulation but an architectural consequence.

6. **Cross-linguistic variation confirms the pattern:** Languages grammaticalize different distinctions, but the pattern holds: grammaticalization → obligatory morphosyntax → tight coupling → strong HPC.

**Implications:**

- **For HPC theory:** Grammatical categories are paradigmatic HPC kinds because they live at the zone where clustering mechanisms are strongest.
- **For Construction Grammar:** The form-meaning pairing thesis receives philosophical grounding—it's not definitional but derivable from the architecture of systematicity.
- **For typology:** Cross-linguistic categories can be assessed empirically—obligatory grammaticalization predicts tight coupling.
- **For grammaticality:** A sentence is grammatical when it achieves successful form-meaning coupling within the systematic, obligatory, learnable patterns of the language.

**The book's argument is strengthened:** Morphosyntax isn't arbitrarily chosen as the domain of grammatical categories. It's where grammar **must** live, given the convergence of formal systematicity and semantic compositionality at the interface.
