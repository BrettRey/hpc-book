**Context:** Appears in a JoL special issue that Brett is editing.

## Summary

Argues that two superficially similar "slash" notations — GPSG's SLASH (for wh-extraction gaps) and Categorial Grammar's slash (for argument selection) — should NOT be unified, despite Steedman's proposal to do so.

---

## Key Data: Lakoff Chain Asymmetry

**Lakoff chains** = coordination chains with >2 conjuncts, only the last with overt *and/or*.

### Wh-extraction — gap can be anywhere:
- "The candidate who Sandy likes ___, Lee hates ___, and Kim admires ___" ✓
- "The candidate who Sandy likes ___, Lee doesn't care for, and Kim admires ___" ✓

### Right Node Raising — gap MUST be in rightmost conjunct:
- "Sandy likes ___, Lee hates ___, and Kim admires ___ all three candidates" ✓
- *"Sandy likes all three candidates, Lee hates ___, and Kim admires ___" ✗

## HPC Relevance

This is a **failed lumping** case. The label "extraction" suggests a unified category, but the coordination asymmetry reveals two distinct mechanisms:
- RNR: CG function composition (requires rightward directionality)
- Wh-extraction: GPSG-like SLASH passing (position-independent)

**Parallel:** Like calling both "pragmatics" or both "adverb" — the surface similarity masks mechanistic heterogeneity.

## Potential Book Locations

- **Ch 8 (Failure Modes):** Example of "fat cluster" or failed unification — coordination test as diagnostic
- **Ch 10 (Word Classes/Syntactic Categories):** If discussing syntactic categories as HPCs, the SLASH/slash distinction is a clean case
