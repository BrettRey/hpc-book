# Chapter 13: Grammaticality itself — Planning Notes

**Date:** December 15, 2025  
**Status:** Planning notes (no prose drafted)

## Why this chapter needs a “double copula” example

The double-\mention{be} pattern (e.g. \mention{The thing is is that...}) is a compact way to show why \term{grammaticality} can’t be read straight off any single channel (school norms, edited prose, introspective “correctness” judgments, corpus frequency, or processing fluency).

It’s high payoff because it naturally forces the reader to separate:

- **A maintained constructional frame** (e.g. \mention{the thing is (that) ...}) from
- **Online production dynamics** (restart/repair, incremental planning) and from
- **Institutional policing** (copy-editing norms, classroom correction, stigma).

That tri-part split is the chapter’s thesis in miniature.

## The phenomenon (minimal description)

- Common speech pattern: \mention{The thing is is that...}, \mention{What it is is...}, \mention{The problem is is...}
- Strong register asymmetry: typical in spontaneous speech; rare in edited academic prose; often treated as an “error” in prescriptive contexts.
- Intuitive acceptability split: many speakers produce it while also disavowing it as “wrong”.

The key is to treat this not as a curiosity but as a diagnostic: it exhibits stability in use alongside instability in metalinguistic evaluation.

## What it should do in Ch 13 (functions)

### 1) Demonstrate “measurement-channel divergence”

Use double-copula to motivate the claim that grammaticality is a cluster accessed by multiple instruments that can disagree:

- **Production evidence:** spontaneous tokens, especially in planning-heavy discourse frames.
- **Comprehension evidence:** listeners typically parse it without breakdown (often unnoticed).
- **Judgment evidence:** explicit judgments may be harsher under “school grammar” framing than under “naturalness” framing.
- **Institutional evidence:** style guides and editors strongly suppress it in print.

### 2) Make the looping effect concrete

Tie it to the “Hacking looping effect” note: prescriptive attention doesn’t just report stability/instability; it becomes a feedback loop that changes distributions (especially in literate, standardised varieties).

### 3) Connect to the HPC grain claim

Frame grammaticality at the right grain:

- The HPC target is not “English grammaticality” in the abstract.
- It’s the stability (or instability) of particular \emph{constructional pairings} and their variants under competing mechanisms.

Double-copula lets you show an item that’s stable in one ecology (spoken, informal, realtime planning) and actively suppressed in another (edited prose), without treating that as contradiction.

## Mechanism sketch (for later prose, not to write now)

Candidate maintenance story to test (don’t overcommit without data):

- **Entrenchment of a frame:** \mention{The thing is ...} as a high-frequency discourse organiser.
- **Repair/restart:** speakers launch the frame, then re-enter copular predication before the complement is fully planned, yielding \mention{is is}.
- **Prosody/punctuation:** speech prosody resolves what print would mark with commas or dashes; in writing, punctuation norms make the doubled copula look “ungrammatical” even when speech parsing is fine.
- **Institutional suppression:** education and editing reduce overt rate in formal writing without necessarily removing the underlying production pathway.

---

## Predictions / disconfirmers (shape only)

Predictions that would support the chapter’s argument:

- Higher rates in spontaneous speech than in edited corpora, with strong sensitivity to task, audience, and self-monitoring.
- Concentration in a small set of lexicalised frames (\mention{the thing is}, \mention{what it is}, \mention{the problem is}).
- Judgment variance that is instruction-sensitive (“correctness” vs “naturalness”), consistent with multiple measurement channels.

Disconfirming patterns (would force a rethink of the example’s role):

- No register/task sensitivity (rates stable across speech vs edited writing).
- No frame concentration (uniform distribution across copular contexts).
- No instructional effect on judgments.

## Where to place it in Ch 13 (structural note)

Best as the opening vignette (parallel to \mention{otherwise} in Ch 1), because it puts all three themes on the table immediately:

1) stability in use, 2) disagreement in judgments, 3) institutional looping.

Keep it as a running thread: return to it after introducing “grammaticality as HPC cluster” to show how each mechanism predicts a different facet of the pattern.
