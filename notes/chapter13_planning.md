## What Chapter 12 has to do (given the broadened scope)

Chapter 12 is where the book cashes a promissory note: the HPC framework isn’t a metaphysics of *grammar-only* categories. But it also isn’t a license to call everything a kind.

So the chapter needs two non-grammar major cases:

1. **A positive case** where the Two-Diagnostic Test is plausibly satisfied outside morphosyntax.  
   Chosen motif: the /ɪ/–/ɛ/ contrast (the \mention{pin}/\mention{pen} boundary).

2. **A negative or grain-sensitive case** where the label names a useful phenomenon but not a single HPC at that grain.  
   Chosen motif: academic–casual register plus honorifics/politeness (as a bundled social category).

The rhetorical job: show that the framework scales, and that it also tells you when *not* to scale.

## Case A (positive): /ɪ/–/ɛ/ as a phonological HPC target

### The phenomenon

- For many English speakers, /ɪ/ vs /ɛ/ anchors lexical contrasts (\mention{pin} vs \mention{pen}).
- In some varieties, the contrast neutralises in particular environments (before nasals is the familiar story), which makes this a natural place to talk about boundary stability plus conditioned failure.

### What the “cluster” is (properties that travel together)

Not a definition of /ɪ/ or /ɛ/, but a converging bundle:

- **Acoustic cues:** distributions in F1/F2 space; cue trading; contextual variation from coarticulation.
- **Production routines:** reliable articulatory targets (with contextual undershoot).
- **Lexical contrast:** minimal pairs and near-minimal pairs that “pay” for the contrast.
- **Phonotactic distribution:** where the vowels are licensed and how they pattern in the inventory.
- **Perceptual categorisation:** the listener’s mapping from continuous cues to discrete classes.
- **(Optional) orthographic scaffolding:** spelling as an additional stabiliser in literate communities (use cautiously; don’t overclaim).

The HPC claim here is local: a phoneme contrast is a maintained cluster of cue-bundles and behavioural dispositions, not an essence.

### Stabilisers to emphasise (mechanisms)

Map these explicitly onto the book’s stabiliser palette:

- **Acquisition:** distributional learning + category formation under noise.
- **Entrenchment:** high-frequency words give dense, repeated evidence; low-frequency words “ride along”.
- **Interactive alignment:** phonetic accommodation can reinforce community norms.
- **Transmission:** iterated learning over generations; the sound change literature as the macro-timescale.
- **Functional pressure:** contrast maintenance when the contrast has communicative load; drift/merger where the load is low or cues are unreliable.
- **Social indexing:** the contrast (and its conditioned loss) as dialect identity signal.

### Diagnostics and disconfirmers (notes, not prose)

- **Projectibility (what the good bet looks like):** from finite exposure, speakers can classify new tokens, understand novel minimal pairs, and generalise the contrast to new lexical items in the relevant environments.
- **Homeostasis (what perturbation should do):** perturb the stabilisers (cue reliability, input mix, alignment ecology) and you should see predictable fraying: conditioned neutralisation, increased variance, near-mergers, reweighting of cues.
- **Disconfirmation condition (shape):** find a community where /ɪ/–/ɛ/ is highly projectible and stable *without* any stable cue bundle, lexical anchoring, or alignment/transmission support (i.e., no plausible maintenance story). If that existed, the HPC framing would be idle.

## Case B (negative / grain-sensitive): academic–casual register and politeness/honorifics

### The target to keep straight

This is a perfect “grain” demonstration if framed carefully:

- **Academic register (English)** is a real phenomenon, but at book-level grain it’s plausibly an *ecosystem label*: a moving bundle of norms, genres, and discipline-specific conventions.
- **Politeness/honorific systems** mix at least three things that can come apart:
  1) grammar-coded honorific morphology (language-internal, often quite projectible),  
  2) register packages (“formal”, “casual”, “deferential”),  
  3) pragmatic inference (politeness as interactional meaning).

The non-kind claim should target the *umbrella*: “politeness register” (or “academic register”) as a single cluster at coarse grain.

### Why it’s a good failure case (what to show)

- **Projectibility can be high while ontology is messy:** within a community, you can often predict that academic writing avoids \mention{gonna}, tolerates heavy nominal style, etc. But the feature bundle is not stable across genres, disciplines, and time.
- **Mechanisms are heterogeneous:** schooling, gatekeeping, editorial norms, audience design, identity work, platform constraints. The bundle can be maintained as a *package* in some settings, but it’s rarely a single mechanism-maintained cluster with a stable internal geometry.
- **Decomposition is the punchline:** at finer grains, you may recover HPC-ish units (specific constructions, formulaic sequences, particular honorific paradigms), while the macro-label remains an ecological convenience.

### Diagnostics and disconfirmers (notes, not prose)

- **Projectibility diagnostic:** “academic vs casual” classification is easy; the hard question is whether what projects is one cluster or many loosely correlated cues.
- **Homeostasis diagnostic:** ask what happens under perturbation (platform shift, community change, institutional weakening). Prediction: rapid reweighting and partial bundle collapse rather than a single fraying trajectory.
- **Disconfirmation condition (shape):** if “academic register” (or “politeness register”) exhibited stable, cross-context covariation with a small set of shared stabilisers that reliably rebuilt the same cluster under perturbation, it would look more like a genuine HPC at that grain.

### Likely citations already in `references.bib` (for later integration)

- Register/genre drift and academic style: `biber1989`, `bibergray2016`, `leech2009`
- Social meaning and indexicality: `eckert2000`, `Eckert2012`, `Silverstein1976`
- Honorifics/politeness: `ide2005`

## Payoff links (where this plugs into the rest of the book)

- **To Ch 5:** phoneme discreteness is the cleanest “continuous substrate → discrete boundary” illustration that isn’t morphosyntax.
- **To Ch 8:** register/politeness is the cleanest “grain problem” illustration outside grammar (ecosystem label vs kind).
- **To Ch 9:** the “two clusters + coupling” architecture can reappear (phonology: cues vs social indexing; register: social signals vs grammatical resources).
- **To Ch 14 (Grammaticality):** The packaging tightness of these bundles matters. Reynolds (2026) shows how *determiner--head* packaging ($k=4$) is so tight it creates a "statistical void" (LBE) that feels like a hard rule. This previews the Entrenchment argument.

## Open choices (defer until drafting)

- Whether to treat honorific morphology as a *mini* positive case inside the register chapter (to make the decomposition vivid).
- Whether to include a single schematic figure for each case (phoneme: two clusters in cue space; register: overlapping cue bundles with shifting weights).
