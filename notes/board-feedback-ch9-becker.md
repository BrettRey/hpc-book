# Board feedback (Becker) — Chapter 9 “Countability”

I read this chapter as someone you’re trying to *bring along* into a new way of seeing familiar material. Most of the time, you do that: you give me a concrete scene, a puzzle, and then you walk me through the machinery. The places that worry me are the moments when the prose stops being a guided tour and starts sounding like a brief against an opposing camp. That’s when readers get defensive and stop listening.

## 1) Invitation vs. push-away

**Inviting moves (keep doing these):**
- The LEGO epigraph + opening story is an A+ hook. It makes the problem social, not just technical, and it gives readers a low-stakes way to care before you name “HPC.” (It also quietly reassures them: ordinary speakers aren’t “wrong,” they’re generalizing.)
- You often speak *with* the reader (“Think of it this way…”, “Remember…”, “Now we can ask…”). That’s exactly the voice that makes technical argument feel hospitable.
- The “locks with different tolerances” explanation is a good example of reader-service: a concrete picture that earns the abstraction.

**Push-away risks (where readers may feel handled rather than helped):**
- You sometimes announce conclusions in a way that forecloses the reader’s participation (“proves…”, “the wrong question”, “no version of X…”, “this is robust…”). Those phrases don’t just claim; they *grade* the reader. Even sympathetic readers can feel pushed into a corner.
- The chapter is richest when you’re showing a mechanism at work (LEGO, *pea*, *data*, Welsh). It’s driest when you shift into prosecutorial rhetoric (“Passing the tests”, “The verdict”, “What does this buy us?”), because the voice becomes declarative and adversarial right when you most need trust.
- A few “drafty” intrusions break the spell and remind the reader they’re in a document, not a conversation: the in-text drafting note at line 114 and the footnote quip at line 55. Even if they’re placeholders, they change the felt relationship.

## 2) Places that can sound like you’re attacking the reader’s training

These are the spots where someone trained in features/prototypes, or someone who has internalized prescriptive norms, could feel you’re saying “what you learned was dumb.” You don’t say that—but the *tone markers* can imply it.

- **“Proves” as a scolding verb.**  
  - Line 89 (“…proves that countability is an autonomous grammatical system…”).  
  - Line 122 (“The error proves the mechanism works…”).  
  “Proves” makes disagreement look like stupidity or bad faith. In most academic fields, it also raises hackles because readers know how rarely we really *prove* things.

- **“No version of…” as a dismissal of whole traditions.**  
  - Lines 342–343 (“No version of feature-bundle theory… No version of prototype theory…”).  
  Even if your point is correct, the phrasing sounds like you’ve swept the literature with a broom. Readers who identify with those approaches will stop to argue with you in their heads instead of following your thread.

- **“The wrong question.”**  
  - Line 346 (“The traditional question… is the wrong question.”).  
  This is the kind of sentence that makes a well-trained reader think: “So you’re saying the way I was taught to pose the problem is naïve.” You can get the same rhetorical force by saying “less fruitful” or “it hides the structure.”

- **Little social jabs that hit real people.**  
  - Line 268 (“Scientists say… Tech CEOs say…”).  
  - Line 270 (“…pedantic style guides.”).  
  You’re using these as sociolinguistic color, but some of your readers *are* scientists, editors, teachers, or “style guide people.” If they feel mocked, they won’t trust you when you later need them to accept your mechanism story about institutional norms.

## 3) Rhetorical improvements (how to keep the argument strong without picking fights)

Here are revisions that change *stance* more than content—classic “invite the reader” work.

- **Swap courtroom language for collaborative language.**  
  Replace “proves” with “suggests,” “makes it hard to maintain,” “is strong evidence for,” or “fits best with.”  
  Example (line 89): instead of “proves… not a direct read-out of physics,” try “makes it hard to treat countability as a direct read-out of physical discreteness; grammar is doing independent work here.”

- **When you criticize a framework, grant it a job first.**  
  For feature accounts: “Features are a useful bookkeeping device for the co-occurrence pattern; what they don’t give us on their own is a maintenance story.”  
  For prototypes: “Prototype talk captures gradience; what I’m adding is why the gradience takes this implicational shape.”  
  This keeps readers from feeling you’re taking away their tools; you’re extending them.

- **Turn “wrong question” into “better question.”**  
  Keep your punchline, change the posture:  
  “If we force a binary (‘count or mass’), we miss the internal structure. The more productive question is where a noun sits on the scale and what holds it there.”  
  Same claim, but now the reader doesn’t have to admit error to come with you.

- **Invite counterexamples instead of daring them.**  
  Line 173 (“…contains no such case.”) is a good place to model openness: “I haven’t found a clear counterexample; if you have one, it’s exactly the kind of stress test that would sharpen this account.”

- **Be careful with caricatures in the “data” section.**  
  You can make the sociolinguistic point (register split + institutional norms) without turning groups into props. Describe the distribution (“scientific writing still favors plural agreement; business/tech and speech favor singular”) and let the reader draw the conclusion.

- **One metaphor at a time, with a handrail.**  
  You actually integrate locks/keys with basins/tops well—but some readers will experience “metaphor overload.” A single sentence that says what each image is doing (“locks = local licensing; basin = global stability”) will keep them from feeling lost.

- **Remove drafting asides before this goes out.**  
  Those notes aren’t just cosmetic: they change the implied relationship from “author guiding reader” to “reader overhearing author.” That overhearing stance is colder.

If you want one quick diagnostic: look for sentences whose hidden message is “I’m right and the other guys are wrong.” Those are almost always the ones to rewrite so the hidden message becomes “Let me show you something useful.”
