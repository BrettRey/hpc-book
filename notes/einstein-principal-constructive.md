## The Principal/Constructive Split

**Principal theory**: States constraints that any adequate story must satisfy
**Constructive theory**: Specifies the actual moving parts and dynamics

### Applied to Grammatical Categories

**Principal constraints for linguistic kindhood:**
- Projectibility requirement (categories must support reliable induction)
- Mechanistic accountability (category claims must connect to stabilisers)
- Reciprocal stabilisation (categories and mechanisms co-shape each other)
- Myriological coherence (cross-level consistency)

**Constructive demands:**
- Specify effective parts (relative to scale and question)
- Specify stabilising dynamics
- Specify epistemic tests
- Specify hermeneutical mapping rules (how formal labels connect to causal stories)

## The Four-Ingredient Checklist for Grammar

### 1. Effective Moving Parts (Kinematics)

Not metaphysically ultimate — whatever your model treats as basic for the question at hand.

Candidates by framework:
- Lexical items and their distributional/semantic profiles
- Constructions
- Morphosyntactic exponents
- Feature bundles
- Processing-relevant cues
- Speaker-level representations
- Community-level norms

**Key insight**: Different choices of effective moving parts should still allow cross-level coherence.

### 2. Configuration Space

The space of *possible* category systems given a set of stabilising constraints.

Can be defined at multiple scales:
- Token-level utterance states
- Idiolect-level category partitions
- Community-level distributions
- Typological-level solution spaces

Gives elegant framing for: Why do some category systems recur crosslinguistically while others are rare or unstable?

### 3. Laws/Dynamics

Not timeless laws in the physics sense. Rather:
- Acquisition dynamics
- Analogy and generalisation dynamics
- Entrenchment and frequency effects
- Processing constraints
- Interactional alignment
- Diachronic pathways
- Institutional standardisation

**Key insight**: The "laws" may be plural, partially redundant, and jointly sufficient without any one being necessary. That *is* a respectable constructive story — just not a Newtonian one.

### 4. Epistemology

How do we assign confidence to category claims?
- Inter-speaker agreement patterns
- Test–retest stability
- Sensitivity to frequency and entrenchment
- Robustness under perturbation (genre shift, register shift, new items)

### 5. Hermeneutics

A formal taxonomy is only as good as its *connection rules* to the causal story.

**Hermeneutical risk**: Proving something about the elegance of a label system, then quietly sliding to the claim that you've proven something about the ontology of grammar.

**Antidote**: No hermeneutical leap without a stabiliser story.

## Myriological Self-Consistency (Cross-Level Coherence)

**Linguistic analogue:**

A category theory should deliver consistent explanatory payoffs whether we treat a phenomenon at:
- the level of subpatterns,
- the construction,
- the category,
- or the wider system.

**Test:**

If I treat X as:
- a bundle of micro-regularities, OR
- a member of a broader category,
do I get compatible predictions about behaviour, learning, and change?

If not, you've found one of three things:
1. A heterogeneous or "lumpy" category
2. A mislocated mechanism
3. A label whose scope is historically inherited rather than causally real

This is the "failure modes are diagnostic" point upgraded into a **cross-level coherence requirement**.

## Markov vs Non-Markov: A Way to Talk About History

- A purely synchronic, state-based category model is "Markov-ish"
- Usage-based and entrenchment-heavy accounts are overtly **non-Markovian** (system's present state is not intelligible without its learning history)

**Reconciliation**: The "present state" can be enriched to include memory traces. A model can *look* Markov at the right state description while still being historically grounded.

This frames why diachrony and acquisition aren't optional add-ons in a serious metaphysics of categories.

## Integration Notes

- **Principal/constructive distinction**: Could frame Chapter 7 or a later methodology chapter
- **Myriological coherence**: Added to Chapter 7 (cross-level coherence section)
- **Effective moving parts as scale-relative**: Already implicit in multilevel mechanism story; could be made explicit
- **Markov/non-Markov**: Could fit mechanisms chapter or ABM chapter
