# Notes for Part II: Insights from Khalidi

This document tracks insights from Muhammad Ali Khalidi's work on natural kinds, specifically for refining Chapter 1 and developing Part II of the book.

## Reviewed Papers

### 1. Khalidi (2013) - Natural categories and human kinds
**Location**: `literature/Khalidi - 2013 - Natural categories and human kinds Classification in the natural and social sciences copy.pdf`

**Key Insights for Chapter 1 & 2:**
*   **Five features of Essentialism** (useful for Chapter 2 "Essentialism and its discontents"):
    1.  **Necessity and sufficiency**: All members have P, only members have P.
    2.  **Modal necessity**: Same properties in all possible worlds.
    3.  **Intrinsicality**: Properties possessed independently of relations to other things.
    4.  **Microstructure**: Underlying microphysical properties.
    5.  **Discoverability by science**: Properties ascertained by scientific inquiry.
*   **Critique of Intrinsicality**: Khalidi argues natural kinds *can* be extrinsic/relational.
    *   Physics examples: Quarks (bonded), Fermions (Pauli exclusion principle).
    *   Biology examples: Species defined by lineage/ancestry (origin essentialism).
    *   *Application to Linguistics*: Grammatical categories are inherently relational (defined by distribution, opposition, system role). This supports the HPC view which allows for relational properties.
*   **Simple Causal Theory** (Chapter 2 Conclusion):
    *   "A natural kind is associated with a set of properties whose co-instantiation causes the instantiation of other properties."
    *   **Naturalness as a matter of degree**: Depends on richness of network, strength of links, range of conditions.
    *   *Insight*: This aligns perfectly with the gradient nature of linguistic categories. Some are "more natural" (stronger clustering) than others.
*   **Special Sciences** (Chapter 3):
    *   Argues special sciences (biology, sociology) can have natural kinds.
    *   Addresses "multiple realizability" (relevant for phonemes/constructions realized differently?).
*   **Institutional vs. Causal Social Kinds** (Chapter 4):
    *   Critiques Searle's view that all social kinds are "ontologically subjective" (depend on being thought of as such).
    *   Distinguishes kinds like *money* (institutional, requires collective intentionality) from kinds like *recession* (causal social kind, exists regardless of whether we label it).
    *   *Application to Linguistics*: Are grammatical categories like money or recession?
        *   Prescriptive rules might be like money.
        *   Natural grammatical categories (noun, subject) are like recession/species—they exist due to causal mechanisms, not just convention.

### 2. Khalidi (2015) - Natural kinds as nodes in causal networks
**Location**: `literature/Khalidi - 2015 - Natural kinds as nodes in causal networks copy.pdf`

**Key Insights:**
*   **Nodes in Causal Networks**: Natural kinds are "ordered hierarchies of properties" related as causes and effects.
*   **Etiological Kinds / Copied Kinds**:
    *   Discusses kinds individuated by causal history (etiology) rather than just synchronic properties.
    *   **Copied Kinds**: Members produced from each other or a common template (e.g., artifacts, biological species).
    *   *Relevance*: Linguistic items are "copied kinds" par excellence (transmission/iterated learning).
    *   Explicitly mentions "comparative linguistics" as a "paleontological etiological science".
    *   *Insight*: Grammatical categories are stabilized by their history of transmission (etiology) as much as their functional role.

### 3. Khalidi (Unknown) - Natural Kinds
**Location**: `literature/Khalidi - Unknown - Natural Kinds copy.pdf`

**Key Insights:**
*   **Projectibility**: Reaffirms that the hallmark of natural kinds is projectibility (supporting inductive inference).
*   **Clustering**: Kinds are identified with clusters of properties, not mere disjunctions.
*   **Simple Causal Theory**: Explicitly mentions defending the "simple causal theory" in Section 2.4.
*   *Relevance*: Good general reference for the projectibility argument in Chapter 6.

### 4. Khalidi (2001) - Innateness and domain specificity
**Location**: `literature/Khalidi - 2001 - Innateness and domain specificity copy.pdf`

**Key Insights:**
*   **Distinction**: Innateness and domain specificity are logically distinct.
*   **Triggering Model**: Discusses the poverty of the stimulus argument.
*   *Relevance*: Useful for Chapter 7 (Mechanisms) when discussing acquisition mechanisms. Nuances the debate between nativism and empiricism.

### 5. Khalidi (2017) - Neural correlates without reduction
**Location**: `literature/Khalidi - 2017 - Neural correlates without reduction The case of the critical period copy.pdf`

**Key Insights:**
*   **Crosscutting Taxonomies**: Psychological kinds and neural kinds have a many-to-many relationship.
*   **Etiological Individuation**: Psychological kinds are often individuated by etiology (history/environment), while neural mechanisms are not.
*   **Non-Reductionism**: This blocks type reduction.
*   *Relevance*: Argument against reducing linguistic categories to pure cognition/neurology. Linguistic categories are individuated by history/social function.

## Synthesis for Chapter 1 & Part II

### Potential Flaws in Current Chapter 1
*   **Implicit Essentialism?**: Does Chapter 1 inadvertently suggest that "real" natural kinds *must* be intrinsic or microstructural (like gold/water)?
    *   *Correction*: We must explicitly state (or ensure we don't deny) that natural kinds can be historical/extrinsic (like species or "copied kinds").
    *   *Action*: Check if we imply that "social" or "historical" means "not natural". Khalidi argues social/historical kinds *are* natural kinds if they have causal power.

### Insights to Improve Chapter 1
1.  **Naturalness as Degree**: Use Khalidi's "Simple Causal Theory" to argue that categoryhood is a matter of degree based on the richness of the causal network.
2.  **Etiological Kinds**: Explicitly frame grammatical categories as "copied kinds" (stabilized by transmission history).
3.  **Causal vs. Institutional**: Distinguish between "money-like" rules (prescriptive) and "recession-like" categories (natural social kinds).

### Notes for Part II (Chapters 5-8)
*   **Chapter 5 (Kinds without essences)**: Use the "Simple Causal Theory" as the formal definition.
*   **Chapter 6 (Projectibility)**: Use the "Projectibility" argument from Khalidi (Unknown/2013).
*   **Chapter 7 (Mechanisms)**:
    *   Use "Etiological/Copied Kinds" to explain transmission mechanisms.
    *   Use "Crosscutting Taxonomies" to explain why linguistic categories aren't just cognitive categories.
