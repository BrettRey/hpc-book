# Peirce as Peer Reviewer

The book is already doing something Peirce would recognize as deeply pragmatist (and quietly semiotic). The through-line—categories are real because they are maintained, and they earn their keep by supporting reliable inference—tracks three Peircean commitments:

1. Anti-essentialism without sliding into nominalism (his scholastic realism about "generals")
2. Meaning as the upshot of habits and inferential consequences (pragmaticism)
3. Inquiry as a social, self-correcting practice where "kinds" are what stabilize abductive/inductive success

**Where he would press hardest**: the triadicity of sign action (not just "form ↔ value" as a dyad), the irreducibility of vagueness/indeterminacy in signs, and the idea that norms live in communities of practice rather than in solitary competence.

## Chapter-by-Chapter Comments

### Chapter 1 — Words That Won't Hold Still

**Likes**: Stability-of-instability framing is essentially Thirdness talk. The move from "what is X?" to "what maintains X?" aligns with his insistence on cashing out concepts in terms of conceivable effects and habits.

**Pushes**: Won't automatically grant sharp structure—his writings on vagueness treat indeterminacy as sometimes objective, not merely epistemic. Would think you're leaving unifying leverage on the table by not framing as "sign habits in semiosis."

**Leverage**: Add triadic mapping early: "form" = sign-vehicle; "value" = interpretant; "object" = structural relation or kind-level construal. The Huddleston vignette is a perfect site for Peirce's idea that a sign's meaning is a living habit.

---

### Chapter 2 — Essentialism Examined

**Likes**: Institutional dynamics map onto his "fixation of belief" typology (tenacity, authority, a priori taste, scientific method). Species parallel is Peirce-friendly.

**Pushes**: Would want you to make room for "real definition" as an abductively earned hypothesis about lawful habits—definitions as the *output* of inquiry, not its starting point.

**Leverage**: Tie essentialism to semiotic economy: definitional crispness functions as a cheap interpretant (fast coordination) even when it isn't a good guide to the dynamical object (the mechanisms).

---

### Chapter 3 — What We Haven't Been Asking

**Likes**: Most Peircean chapter in agenda—relocates the question from definitional essence to inferential payoff. Your anti-nominalism is where his own would snap into focus: "generals are real" because laws/habits are real.

**Pushes**: Would want the logic of inquiry explicit: the "maintenance view" is an abductive proposal, and your diagnostics are the inductive/deductive machinery that tests it.

**Leverage**: Align method with Peirce's three inferences:
- Abduction: propose stabilizers to explain covariance and boundary behavior
- Deduction: derive predicted signatures (perturbation sensitivity, transfer curves, error profiles)
- Induction: test on held-out corpora/communities/periods; revise stabilizer weights

---

### Chapter 4 — Kinds Without Essences

**Likes**: Real kinds as clusters stabilized by multiple mechanisms fits his realism about Thirdness. A Peircean would read "homeostasis" as a modern, naturalized vocabulary for "habit."

**Pushes**: His realism is not only epistemic but metaphysical. If you slide toward "kinds are real because useful," he'll insist you keep the causal teeth.

**Leverage**: Connect "stabilizers" to Peirce's final causation/habit-taking: not teleology-as-design, but tendency-to-regularize under repeated interaction. Tagline: categories are not "containers" but "general laws of interpretation" that live in practices.

---

### Chapter 5 — Discrete from Continuous

**Likes**: Separation of sharp category structure from gradient evidence is congenial to his view that our signs and measurements are fallible and noisy.

**Pushes**: Most likely to resist your default metaphysics. Peirce treats vagueness as a real feature of signs, not merely ignorance about a sharp boundary.

**Leverage**: Borrow his distinction between generality and vagueness. Reframe "sharp-in-structure" as a claim about the final interpretant: membership becomes determinate only relative to a stabilized communal habit.

---

### Chapter 6 — Projectibility and the Good Bet

**Likes**: Projectibility is a Peircean keyword: kinds are what make induction possible. Field-relative projectibility fits his pragmaticism.

**Pushes**: Will warn against treating "good bet" as merely pragmatic success. Successful projection is evidence of a real general, not merely a convenient classification.

**Leverage**: Make explicit that projectibility is a property of sign systems: a category "projects" when its symbols reliably generate correct interpretants in new tokens. Let Peirce's "community of inquiry" do work here.

---

### Chapter 7 — The Stabilizers

**Likes**: Catalog of habit-forming and habit-preserving mechanisms across timescales. He would treat it as an empirical decomposition of Thirdness into its causal supports.

**Pushes**: May worry that "mechanism" language tempts a purely efficient-cause story. Sign habits have a normative dimension: symbols work because they carry rules of correct use, not merely because of frequency.

**Leverage**: Map onto stabilizers:
- Symbolic stabilization: conventions and habits (entrenchment, normative enforcement)
- Indexical stabilization: context-linked cues (alignment in interaction, deictic anchoring)
- Iconic stabilization: similarity-based generalization (analogy, exemplar clustering)

---

### Chapter 8 — Failure Modes

**Likes**: Anti-inflation chapter. Thin/fat/negative taxonomy resembles his distinction between real vs nominal distinctions.

**Pushes**: Be careful with "epistemic kinds"—interest-relative concepts can still be real if they track stable habits/laws.

**Leverage**: Treat institutions as semiotic stabilizers that enforce interpretants. Add one explicit "semiotic failure mode": cases where the sign-object link is stable but interpretants diverge across subcommunities.

---

### Chapter 9 — Countability

**Likes**: The coupling architecture (count cluster vs individuation cluster) is naturally triadic: form, construal, and the worldly/mental object.

**Pushes**: The LEGO epigraph is a semiotic battle over interpretants—use that.

**Leverage**: Recast the LEGO story as symbol growth and interpretant drift: the company attempts to legislate a narrow interpretant; the community's habit generalizes it. Distinguish:
- object: the construal of individuated units vs mass stuff
- sign: plural morphology, quantifier compatibility
- interpretant: the hearer's expectations about countable operations

---

### Chapter 10 — Definiteness and Deitality

**Likes**: Tailor-made for Peirce—demonstratives and definite articles live at the symbol–index interface. Your split is naturally triadic.

**Pushes**: Might resist treating "definiteness" as purely about "reference in the world." For Peirce, the object can be general.

**Leverage**: Classify key determiners by dominant sign relation:
- demonstratives: heavily indexical (context-linked object)
- "the": symbolic but with inherited indexical constraints
- proper names: symbolic types whose indexical anchoring is delegated to collateral experience

---

### Chapter 11 — Lexical Categories and Their Maintenance

**Likes**: "Wastebasket vs skeleton vs mimics" is a nice Peircean natural-history move. Your argument that pronouns are braided rather than unified is especially Peircean.

**Pushes**: Would emphasize that word classes are stabilized because they support recurring inferential roles in action and interpretation.

**Leverage**: Use icon/index/symbol trio to reframe "pronoun mimicry":
- deictic pronouns behave indexically (existential connection to situation)
- anaphoric pronouns behave indexically via discourse contiguity
- interrogative/relative forms behave as symbols that legislate a missing value

---

### Chapter 12 — Pro-form Gender

**Likes**: Designatum-driven selection is a Peircean dream. Chain coherence is interpretant stabilization across a discourse.

**Pushes**: Be explicit about levels of "object." Your designatum is doing work close to his "immediate object" (the object as represented), while the actual referent is the "dynamical object."

**Leverage**: Add a compact mapping:
- dynamical object: the real-world entity (dog, customer)
- immediate object: the construed entity (pet/personified agent vs animal)
- interpretant: pronoun choice and the expectations it induces

---

### Chapter 13 — The Category Zipper

**Likes**: If there is a single chapter where Peirce would say "yes, now you're talking my language," it is this one. Coupling regimes diagnose different ways signs can fail.

**Pushes**: Will not let you keep "form" and "value" as a two-place relation. The missing third term is the object.

**Leverage**: Natural home for a short Peircean interlude:
- Transparent coupling: high indexical/iconic constraint ("slips")
- Architectural coupling: symbol-governed compositional habits ("jams")
- Loose coupling: interpretants heavily underwritten by collateral experience ("mis-tracking")

---

### Chapter 14 — Grammaticality Itself

**Likes**: "Feeling of ungrammaticality" as a stabilizer is almost exactly his notion that doubt is an irritant that forces repair. Acceptability/grammaticality split is congenial.

**Pushes**: The "feeling" is part of the normative apparatus that makes symbols work. Grammaticality is a property of sign use in a community.

**Leverage**: Use his three categories:
- Firstness: the qualitative feel of "wrongness" (detector phenomenology)
- Secondness: the reactive resistance and repair behavior
- Thirdness: the stabilized habit/rule that makes the correction meaningful

---

### Chapter 16 — What Changes

**Likes**: Anti-nominalist ending lands exactly where he stands. Methodological pluralism fits his view that sciences are differentiated by aims and methods, yet can converge on real generals.

**Pushes**: Keep "realism" on the table, not just "useful pattern." Keep normativity explicit.

**Leverage**: Your line "Structure and social meaning are the same math read in opposite directions" could be explicitly tied to indexical semiosis.

---

## Global Revision Strategy

To make the whole book "more Peircean" without turning it into a Peirce book:

1. Put a very short Peircean semiotic spine in Chapter 13 (or as an interlude just before Part III): sign–object–interpretant; icon/index/symbol as dominant modes; abduction/deduction/induction as the logic of your diagnostics.

2. In each Part III case study, add one paragraph that explicitly identifies:
   - (a) the sign forms,
   - (b) the object as construed (token vs type, immediate vs dynamical),
   - (c) the interpretants whose stability you are measuring (projectibility) and maintaining (homeostasis).

This would make your existing machinery feel less like a bespoke framework and more like a domain-specific instance of a general theory of semiosis—exactly the kind of "unification without essentialism" that Peirce spent his life chasing.

## Note on Missing Chapter

Your manuscript points to a "social stabilization" chapter that isn't in the files received. From a Peircean perspective, that chapter is where you can most profitably connect:
- (i) communities as the locus of habit,
- (ii) institutional enforcement as interpretant policing,
- (iii) social indexicality as an inferential channel.

Peirce would want it to say: "the grammar is a public habit of sign use; variation is not noise but stratified semiosis."
