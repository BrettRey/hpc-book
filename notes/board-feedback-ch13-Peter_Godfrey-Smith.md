Here are a few thoughts on your "Stack" architecture, viewed through the lens of causal mechanisms and biological individuality.

First, I worry that your **"Hard-Coupled" description of phonemes conflates *constraint* with *regulation*.** In the biological cases I look at (like the evolution of complex cells or multicellularity), we distinguish between stability enforced by physics/chemistry (constraints) and stability maintained by active feedback loops (homeostasis). Your plan cites "quantal regions" (Stevens) and "dispersion" (Lindblom). These look like physical boundary conditions—the shape of the vocal tract and the nonlinearity of the auditory system—acting as a mold. That is distinct from the active "repair" mechanisms or "policing" seen in social norms or biological immune systems. If the phoneme is a stable "basin of attraction" purely because of physics, is it truly a *homeostatic* property cluster in the Boydian sense, or just a stable physical equilibrium? The "load-bearing" part of the HPC analogy requires active maintenance mechanisms in the face of perturbation. Ensure you demonstrate that phonemes *react* to drift, rather than just passively sitting in a physical well.

Second, regarding the **"Decoupling and Re-coupling" narrative**: this sounds dangerously teleological unless you ground it in communicative utility. In biology, we don't say cells "decided" to decouple; we say that modularity conferred a fitness advantage. Why does language decouple form and meaning at the morpheme level only to stitch them back together at the construction level? The mechanism-talk here needs to be evolutionary. Perhaps "hard-coupling" (holistic signals) hits a capacity ceiling, forcing a transition to combinatorial systems (morphemes), which then generates efficiency costs that "chunks" (constructions) solve. If you frame this purely as a structural architectural shift without the selection pressures that drive it, the biological parallel becomes merely decorative. You need to show that these "coupling regimes" are stable evolutionary strategies, not just static layers.

Finally, on the **negative case of "Register"**: this is excellent, as it mirrors the "marginal cases" of Darwinian populations (like a symbiotic collective that isn't quite an organism). However, be careful with your diagnosis. You argue it fails because mechanisms are "heterogeneous." But *all* complex biological individuals have heterogeneous maintenance mechanisms (genes, immune systems, behavioral isolation). The failure of "Register" isn't heterogeneity; it's likely the lack of *tight feedback loops* between the components. In a true HPC kind, if you tweak property A, property B *must* shift to compensate (homeostasis). In a "register bundle," if I drop the passive voice but keep the hedging, the category doesn't collapse; it just drifts. Focus on the *looseness of the causal causal binding*, not just the diversity of the stabilizers.
