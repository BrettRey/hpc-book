# Chapter 7: Mechanisms for Homeostatic Maintenance

## Overview
Chapter 7 should develop the full account of mechanisms that maintain grammatical categories as homeostatic property clusters. This note synthesizes mechanism ideas from three key sources examined during Chapter 1 drafting.

## Source Papers

### 1. Reynolds (stack.tex) - "Language as a Stack of HPCs"
- **Location**: `/Users/brettreynolds/Documents/LLM-CLI-projects/HPC book/literature/stack.tex`
- **Key contribution**: Multi-level mechanisms (phonemes, words, constructions)

**Mechanisms by level:**

**Phonemes:**
- Quantal stability (articulatory "sweet spots")
- Dispersion pressure (maintaining distinctiveness)
- Perceptual magnets (pulling varied pronunciations toward prototypes)
- Community transmission

**Words:**
- Orthographic standardization (via literacy education)
- Frequency-based entrenchment
- Editorial norms (copy-editing, error correction)
- Register/genre licensing (contextual appropriateness)

**Constructions:**
- Cue redundancy (multiple converging signals)
- Frequency and entrenchment
- Normative pressure (editorial practices, style guides)

**Cross-cutting insight:** Mechanisms form a **stack** - body, cognition, and society always co-stabilize. Balance shifts by level but all three are always present.

### 2. Miller (2021) - "Words, Species, and Kinds"
- **Location**: `/Users/brettreynolds/Documents/LLM-CLI-projects/HPC book/literature/Miller - 2021 - Words, Species, and Kinds copy.pdf`
- **Key contribution**: Internal/external mechanism distinction

**Internal (individual) mechanisms:**
- Mental lexicon retrieval - consistent access from memory
- Recognition/interpretation mechanisms
- Derivation consistency - combining items syntactically
- *Note: Not species-specific; can apply to animals, machines with different cognitive structures*

**External (social) mechanisms:**
- Performance standards (Hawthorne & Lepore's "Tolerance Principle")
- Community norms - accepted regularities across speakers
- Context-specific standards - formal vs. informal registers
- Spelling/pronunciation tolerance limits

**Critical insight:** Neither internal nor external mechanisms alone are sufficient - **both required together** to maintain homeostatic clustering.

### 3. Reynolds (countability.tex) - "Homeostatic Maintenance of English Countability"
- **Location**: `/Users/brettreynolds/Documents/LLM-CLI-projects/HPC book/literature/countability.tex`
- **Key contribution**: Multi-timescale framework and bidirectional inference

**Core mechanism: Bidirectional inference**
- Comprehension: Count morphosyntax → individuated construal
- Production: Individuated construal → count morphosyntax
- Creates mutual predictiveness between form and meaning

**Multi-timescale stabilizers (Section 2.2, lines 134-137):**
1. **Fastest (milliseconds):** Bidirectional inference during processing
2. **Intermediate (years):** Acquisition transmission, schema extension, paradigmatic pressure
3. **Slowest (decades):** Institutional norms (style guides, editorial practice, pedagogy)

**Interaction:** "The fast loop generates usage patterns; the slow loop crystallizes them into community standards"

**Specific mechanisms:**
- Schema extension (learners generalize from partial patterns)
- Entrenchment effects (Bybee 2010)
- Functional anchoring (alternative lexemes relieve pressure)
- Paradigmatic pressure (regularization toward dominant patterns)
- Iterated transmission (Kirby et al. 2008)
- Processing costs (violations reinforce canonical patterns)

## Synthesis for Chapter 7

### Organizational Framework

**Option 1: By Timescale**
- Millisecond mechanisms (processing, bidirectional inference)
- Year mechanisms (acquisition, entrenchment, transmission)
- Decade mechanisms (institutional norms, editorial standards)

**Option 2: By Source (Internal/External)**
- Cognitive mechanisms (mental lexicon, processing, learning)
- Social mechanisms (norms, tolerance principles, institutional enforcement)

**Option 3: By Function**
- Acquisition mechanisms (how clusters are learned)
- Maintenance mechanisms (how clusters persist)
- Transmission mechanisms (how clusters propagate)

**Recommendation:** Use timescale as primary structure (more empirically grounded) with internal/external as secondary dimension.

### Key Theoretical Claims to Develop

1. **Mechanism stacking**: All levels involve body, cognition, and society; balance shifts but all present
2. **Bidirectional coupling**: Form-meaning inference operates in both directions
3. **Multi-level stabilization**: Different mechanisms at different timescales interact
4. **Functional ecology**: Alternatives in the system (e.g., "officer" for "police") affect pressure
5. **Neither deterministic nor random**: Mechanisms bias toward coherence but don't guarantee it

### Evidence to Include

- Acquisition overgeneralization data (Bloom 1994, Barner 2005, Gordon 1985)
- Diachronic cases (pease→pea, data/datum shift)
- Cross-linguistic patterns (Welsh singulatives, classifier languages)
- Processing predictions (priming asymmetries, graded violation costs)
- Corpus frequency patterns (tight vs. loose property distributions)

### Integration with Chapter 1

Chapter 1 preview (current state):
- Acquisition (Tomasello 2003)
- Entrenchment (Bybee 2010)  
- Interactive alignment (Pickering & Garrod 2004)
- Iterated transmission (Kirby et al. 2008)

This is appropriate - gives four canonical mechanisms with citations but doesn't overwhelm. Chapter 7 unpacks the full story.

## Open Questions for Chapter 7

1. How to balance technical precision with accessibility?
2. Should we present formal models (e.g., iterated learning models) or stay conceptual?
3. How much cross-linguistic evidence is enough?
4. Should processing predictions be presented as tested or as testable?
5. How to avoid the chapter becoming a literature review?

## Notes from Chapter 1 Drafting Session

- User emphasized reader experience over our convenience
- Citations should ground claims in established research
- Even preview sections benefit from specific citations
- Multi-timescale framework from countability paper is most comprehensive
- Internal/external distinction from Miller is theoretically important but may be too abstract for intro
