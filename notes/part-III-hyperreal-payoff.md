# Part III: Make Chapter 5's Hyperreal Framework Pay Off

**Date:** 2025-12-09  
**Status:** Planning reminder

## The Debt

Chapter 5 introduces a hyperreal formalisation of tolerance/vagueness. It's mathematically elegant but currently lacks clear empirical payoff. A sceptical reader may ask:

> "Is this necessary? And how would I know?"

**The framework will retrospectively justify itself if Part III chapters use it to explain patterns that simpler approaches can't.**

## Where the Payoff Should Land

### Chapter 9: Definiteness
- Do weak definites and generic definites occupy distinct hyperreal neighbourhoods?
- Can hyperreal tolerance explain why they show different acceptability gradients despite surface similarity?
- Prediction: sharp-but-unknowable boundary between definite/indefinite, with judgment variance tracking hyperreal proximity to boundary.

### Chapter 12: Grammaticality Itself
- Is grammaticality a cluster maintained by tolerance dynamics?
- Can hyperreal modelling explain gradient judgments that Bayesian models can't?
- Prediction: specific functional form of judgment variance near grammaticality boundaries.

## Tests for "Payoff Achieved"

1. **Unique prediction:** Does the hyperreal framework generate an empirical signature that epistemicism or simpler sharp-but-unknowable accounts don't?

2. **Pattern explained:** Is there a specific pattern in the data that *requires* hyperreals rather than merely being *compatible* with them?

3. **Simpler alternatives ruled out:** Could a Bayesian/probabilistic model do the same work? (Note: Polish aspect in Ch. 6 uses standard statistical modelling, not hyperreals.)

## If No Payoff Can Be Delivered

Consider demoting the formal apparatus to an appendix, keeping only the intuitive payoff in Ch. 5:
- Sharp-but-unknowable boundaries
- Tolerance as dynamic rather than fixed
- Phase-transition intuition without the nonstandard-analysis machinery
