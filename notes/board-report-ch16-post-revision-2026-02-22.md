# Advisory Board Follow-up: Chapter 16 After Revision

**Date**: 2026-02-22  
**Scope**: `chapters/chapter16.tex` (post-revision pass)  
**Question**: Does the revised chapter now read as a real empirical gauntlet?

## Panel (selected from `notes/advisory-board.md`)

- William Croft (typology, comparative concepts)
- Adele Goldberg (constructional learning)
- Ray Jackendoff (architectural constraints)
- Peter Godfrey-Smith (philosophy of biology/science)
- Michael Tomasello (acquisition)
- Ewa Dąbrowska (individual variation)
- Deirdre McCloskey (disciplinary rhetoric)
- Wendy Lesser (editorial architecture)
- Carl Zimmer (science communication)
- Edward Tufte (evidence discipline)

## Overall verdict

**Strongly improved. Near-ship with minor optional tightening.**

Board consensus is that the chapter now does what a finale should do: it commits to risky predictions, names defeat conditions, and gives operational hooks that can fail.

## What the board thinks improved

1. The running case now functions as a true handrail, not a passing example (`\mention{data}` diagnostics are explicit and reused).
2. Scope discipline is materially better (language-particular vs comparative vs constructional predictions are now separated).
3. The lag claim is no longer vulnerable to level-privilege misreadings (architectural rate asymmetry is explicit).
4. The downgrade-before-defeat logic is now scientifically credible, not all-or-nothing.
5. The operational note raises the chapter from manifesto to protocol.

## Remaining criticisms (not blockers)

1. **Tufte / Godfrey-Smith**: one explicit numerical decision rule would further harden the gauntlet (example: preregistered out-of-sample lift threshold over random-walk baseline).
2. **Tomasello / Dąbrowska**: acquisition and speaker-variance appear, but still as method list items; one sentence tying predicted developmental ordering to the `\mention{data}` case would strengthen testability.
3. **Croft / Goldberg**: constructional phrasing is now present, but a one-line null case in which a comparative concept remains useful while no stable language-particular category emerges would fully close the typological loop.
4. **McCloskey / Lesser**: ending is strong and clean; no major rhetoric concerns remain.

## Recommendation

**Approved for this revamp objective.**  
If desired, apply one final micro-pass (2--4 sentences total) to add:
- one explicit quantitative threshold example,
- one acquisition-order prediction sentence,
- one comparative-concept null-case example sentence.

Without those, the chapter is still judged publishable in current form for the gauntlet role.
