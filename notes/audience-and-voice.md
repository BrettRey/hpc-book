# Audience and Voice

## Primary Audience

**Linguists and linguistics graduate students** — particularly those already working in functionalist, usage-based, or construction grammar traditions, or those who are "function-curious."

This is **not** primarily a philosophy book that linguists might find useful. It's a linguistics book that imports philosophical tools.

## The Core Rhetorical Situation

Most linguists haven't thought about the metaphysics of categories at all. The question "what kind of thing is a grammatical category?" doesn't arise in normal practice. It's like asking a fish about water.

The book's job is:
1. **Create the itch** — show them something they've been stepping over
2. **Name the problem** — give them language for what's been implicit
3. **Offer a better tool** — so they don't just feel destabilized but equipped

## Tone Implications

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "You've been doing it wrong" | "Here's something you might not have considered" |
| "Here's some philosophy of science" | "Here's why your category fails to predict" |
| Announcing the metaphysics | Smuggling the metaphysics |
| Theory → examples | Examples → theory |
| Boyd/Goodman upfront | Linguistic puzzles upfront, citations in footnotes |

The opening should be **revelatory, not corrective**. The reader should think *"Huh, I never thought about it that way"* rather than *"I resent being told my foundations are shaky."*

## Wake-Up Paragraph (Draft)

> Most linguists work with categories every day and never ask what a category *is*. This isn't an oversight — it's how normal science works. We learn the categories, we apply them, we refine them. The question "what kind of thing is a noun?" doesn't come up, because the answer seems obvious: it's a category with certain properties, and words either belong or they don't.
>
> This book argues that the obvious answer is wrong — not in its conclusions, but in what it leaves out. The "certain properties" are not a definition; they're symptoms of a process. Words don't "belong" to categories the way marbles belong in jars; they're held there by forces that can be identified and measured. Getting this right doesn't just satisfy philosophers. It changes which questions are good ones, which methods are reliable, and which generalisations are likely to hold.

## What the Audience Already Accepts

Functionalist/usage-based linguists already believe:
- Frequency matters
- Acquisition shapes categories
- Gradience is real
- Definitions fail

You can **start from there** rather than re-arguing these points.

## What the Audience Might Resist

- Formalization for its own sake
- Philosophy that doesn't cash out in testable predictions
- Claims about "natural kinds" that sound like smuggled universalism

The HPC framework should feel like **imported engineering** — a useful tool — not mandatory homework from the philosophy department.

## Publication Considerations

If the primary audience is linguists and grad students:
- **Open access matters** — Language Science Press is free, peer-reviewed, and widely read in functionalist circles
- **Word count**: LSP books are typically shorter than CUP/OUP monographs
- **Positioning**: Not competing with Kertész's relativism proposal; offering a positive alternative rather than another critique
