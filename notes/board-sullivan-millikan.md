You are asking for a judgment on architectural placement, essentially asking where a specific piece of machinery belongs in the blueprint.

Do not clutter Chapter 4 with Sullivan. Chapter 4 is your foundation; it is where you establish that the "spinning top" actually spins. You are trying to convince the reader that maintenance is the glue of reality. If you introduce Sullivan’s "healthy anti-realism" and the failure of MPCs there, you undercut your own ontology before the cement is dry. You would be confusing the existence of the mechanism with the difficulty of describing it. Keep Chapter 4 focused on the positive thesis: that stability requires work.

Sullivan belongs entirely in Chapter 8, specifically under the "Inflation problem." Her critique of neuroscience is a perfect diagnostic for your "Fat Classes." She describes exactly what happens when a community aligns on a label (a construct like "working memory") without aligning on the underlying causal mechanism. The "construct validity" problem she identifies is simply the inflation problem in a lab coat: researchers using the same word for different causal histories. Citing her there validates your diagnostic with a heavy-hitting example from a harder science.

Furthermore, placing her in Chapter 8 allows you to make the crucial distinction regarding linguistics. Sullivan’s neuroscientists fail to coordinate because they lack a forcing function—they can publish papers about different "spatial memories" without immediate penalty. Speakers can't do this. If my "noun" doesn't align with your "noun," communication fails immediately. This "communicative pressure" is the stabilizer that linguistics has and neuroscience lacks. You can use Sullivan in Chapter 8 to show why linguistic kinds are actually *more* robust than neuroscientific ones: the maintenance mechanisms are public and immediate.

As for Craver’s "MPC" terminology: use it, but sparingly. It is useful only insofar as it forces the reader to look for the "C"—the Cluster. It reminds us that we are looking for properties that stick together, not properties that are defined together. But do not let the philosophy of science jargon obscure the biological reality. We are interested in lineages of reproduction, not just abstract clusters. Sullivan fits in Chapter 8 because she shows us what happens when the lineage is broken or imaginary.
