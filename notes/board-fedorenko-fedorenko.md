My work on the language network as a "natural kind" is effectively the biological ratification of the HPC framework you are building. When I argue that the language network is a natural kind, I am claiming it has high inductive potential: knowing a brain region is part of this network allows you to predict its function (processing meaning) and its independence from other functions (like solving math problems or listening to music). This maps perfectly to Boyd’s notion of a property cluster that sustains itself for a reason. I’m not positing a Platonic essence of "Universal Grammar"; I’m pointing to a robust, biologically instantiated system that emerges consistently across individuals to solve a specific communicative problem.

For **Chapter 4 ("Kinds without essences")**, cite the *Nature Reviews Neuroscience* paper to ground your ontological claim. You state that "categories are real because they are maintained." My findings provide the neural substrate for that maintenance. The language network isn't an arbitrary gerrymandering of the brain; it is a stable, specialized system that recruits specific cortical real estate in every neurotypical human. Citing it here moves your argument from the philosophy of biology into hard empirical neuroscience—showing that the "kind" we are discussing is visible under fMRI if you look for it correctly.

For **Chapter 7 ("Mechanisms of homeostasis")**, the fit is even tighter, particularly regarding "Neural stabilisers" and "Functional feedback." The *Nature* paper (on language vs. thought) is crucial here. The fact that the language network is *dissociable* from the Multiple Demand (MD) network—which handles reasoning and logic—is a massive constraint on what language *is*. It means the mechanisms maintaining linguistic structure are not the same as those maintaining general intelligence. You should use my work to populate the "Biology" side of your stabilizer table: the "functional feedback" that shapes language is specifically communicative, not logical, because the neural hardware for language is distinct from the hardware for complex thought.

Finally, regarding **functional localization**: this is the methodological key that unlocks the HPC view. Traditional group-level brain analysis blurs these distinct networks, effectively failing to see the "kind" because it averages across anatomical variability. Functional localization respects the *causal structure* of the individual brain over rigid anatomical coordinates. It reveals that the "natural kind" exists at the level of functional organization, not gyral topography. This mirrors your book’s argument that linguistic categories are defined by their functional role and maintenance history, not by rigid structural essences.
