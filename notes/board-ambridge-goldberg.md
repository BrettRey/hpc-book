I’d engage Ambridge (2020) in **both** places, but with different jobs: in **Chapter 4** as a clean foil that helps you triangulate the “maintenance view” (neither essentialist essences nor “mere descriptive convenience”), and in **Chapter 5** for the real payoff—because his central claim is about *mechanism* (what is stored and how generalization happens), not just about the metaphysics of categories. Chapter 4 can use him to sharpen the question “what makes a category real if not an essence?”, while Chapter 5 can show, in concrete cognitive terms, how a system can yield stable, learnable generalizations without requiring a little internal dictionary of classical types.

On (1): exemplar storage does **not** contradict Construction Grammar; it is largely orthogonal to the commitment that learners acquire a network of form–meaning pairings at multiple grains. Usage-based CxG has always had room for item-specific knowledge, frequency effects, and rich memory for tokens. Where Ambridge becomes “radical” is in denying that any stored *schemas* (constructional generalizations) exist at all; that goes further than most CxG positions, which treat schematic constructions as emergent generalizations that can nonetheless be represented (often as graded, probabilistic constraints rather than crisp symbolic categories). So the way to use him is to concede the exemplar-friendly part as consonant with CxG, while resisting the all-or-nothing conclusion that “no stored abstractions” follows from the messiness of category boundaries.

On (2): yes—analogical generalization across exemplars can be treated as a **maintenance mechanism** in your sense, provided you make explicit what it maintains. In a constructional network, analogical extension is not just a productivity engine; it is also a stabilizer: it recruits new items into existing families, aligns speakers on recurring form–function pairings, and (together with competition/preemption and entrenchment) keeps category boundaries from drifting arbitrarily. The key move for Chapter 5 is to say: even if the mind is “doing analogy on the fly,” those analogical processes are exactly the homeostatic dynamics that keep construction families coherent over time and across learners—maintenance can look like flexible pattern completion, not like a static stored definition.

If you want a single “best home,” I’d reserve sustained engagement for **Chapter 5**, where you can cash out the claim that *the same processes that generate generalization also underwrite stability* (maintenance-as-alignment, repair, and renewal). Then use Chapter 4 for a short, strategically placed contrast: Ambridge shows why “stored essences in the head” is the wrong target, and you show why that doesn’t force us into anti-realist language about constructions—constructional kinds can be real because they are maintained by the very usage-based mechanisms he highlights.
