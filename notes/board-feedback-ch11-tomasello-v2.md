# Board Feedback: Chapter 11 (Tomasello)

**From:** Michael Tomasello

**Subject:** Braided categories and the ontogenetic view

You ask how the "braided mechanisms" of referential saturation (deixis, anaphora, interrogatives) look from the perspective of acquisition. If these distinct mechanisms all result in the same surface property—determiner resistance—does the child learn a single category ("Determiner-less Nominals") or three distinct functional islands that happen to converge?

The usage-based answer is clear: the child does not initially learn the braid. The child learns the strands.

## 1. How do children learn braided categories?
They don't—at least, not at first. Children are initially conservative, item-based learners. They learn *today* as a high-frequency holophrase or frozen form used to establish joint attention on the temporal 'now'. They learn *who* as a specific operator in an interrogative frame (*Who is X?*).

The "braid" is an emergent property of the adult system (or the diachronic evolution of the language), not a cognitive primitive for the two-year-old. The child arrives at "determiner resistance" for *today* via simple entrenchment: they never hear *the today*, so they never say it. They arrive at "determiner resistance" for *who* via the interrogative constructional schema.

The "category" only emerges later, as the child schematizes over these distinct instances. If the input consistently treats them alike (zero determiner), the child may eventually form a super-schema, but the "resistance" is driven by the fact that the communicative function (referential saturation) renders the determiner distinctively redundant in the input the child receives. The "mechanism" is the input statistics driven by adult communicative efficiency.

## 2. HPCs vs. Surface Convergence in Acquisition
The diagnostic for a "genuine" HPC (a robustly clustered category) versus a mere surface convergence is **productivity and error patterns**.

If "Determiner Resistors" were a unified natural kind for the child, we would expect cross-strand overgeneralization. For instance, if a child learned that *Monday* resists determiners, and treated it as the same kind of thing as *who*, we might see strange transfers of other properties (e.g., trying to modify *who* with *next* because they can say *next Monday*).

We rarely see such cross-strand errors. This suggests that while these forms cluster distributionally for the linguist, they remain functionally distinct islands for the child for a long time. The "HPC" here is a loose federation of mechanisms that overlap in one dimension (saturation) but not others. The stability comes from the distinct functional anchors (deixis vs. variable binding), not a shared "essence" of determiner-aversion.

## 3. The Today/Monday Puzzle
This is a classic example of surface similarity masking deep functional difference.
*   **Today**: Acquired very early. High frequency. Often treated as an adverbial primitive.
*   **Monday**: Acquired later. Culturally constructed cycle. treated more like a proper name (which is why *next Monday* works like *next Christmas*).

Does the puzzle show up? Yes, in the lack of error. Children do not say *the today*. They might say *the Monday* if they treat it as a common noun (like *the day*), but they generally respect the proper-name grammar of days quickly. The fact that *today* and *Monday* align is a coincidence of saturation strategies—one indexical, one naming. The child navigates this not by learning a rule "Time Words Resist Determiners," but by learning the specific constructional privileges of each item.
