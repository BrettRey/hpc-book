# Book-Wide Slogans and Handles

## The Maintenance View

**Handle**: "the maintenance view"

**Sticky sentence**: "Categories are real because they are maintained."

**Decision date**: December 5, 2025

### Where it appears:

1. **Chapter 1** (impasse, ~line 229): "Neither asks what gives them that shape—what maintains it."
   - Foreshadows the answer without stating it

2. **Chapter 3** (end, before Part II): Introduces the term with the sticky sentence
   - "This is the \term{maintenance view}, and it's what Part II develops."

3. **Chapter 4** (opening): Formally introduces the view and its origin (Boyd's HPC framework)

4. **Chapter 5** (conclusion): "The categories are real because they're maintained, not because they're defined."

### Chapter-specific slogans:

- **Chapter 5**: "dynamic discreteness" and "real gradience" (twin themes)

### Why this works:

- Positions against essentialism (maintenance, not definition)
- Positions against prototype theory (stability, not just gradience)
- Simple enough to travel without the argument
- Can be used generously toward predecessors ("prototype theory documented gradience; the maintenance view explains why it persists")

### Companion phrases:

- "Gradience is easy; stability is the puzzle."
- "Categories persist because mechanisms hold them in place."
