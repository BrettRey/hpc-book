## Summary

This chapter is strongest when it treats countability as an *interface system* whose graded structure is *maintained* by multiple reinforcing mechanisms (processing, acquisition, conventionalization, lexical competition). That framing is compatible with prototype theory—indeed, much of the descriptive picture *is* prototype structure—but the chapter sometimes risks presenting familiar prototype facts as if they require a wholly new framework. The opportunity is to position the HPC story as: **prototype effects + a maintenance explanation + specific mechanistic predictions** (especially the “tight-before-loose” implicational order and the stability/instability diagnostics).

## (1) Relation to prototype theory — and “reinventing the wheel”

### Where you are already doing prototype theory (implicitly)
- The individuation profile is explicitly described as “a prototype, not a rigid definition,” with graded cases like *cloud* and *cattle*. That’s exactly the core prototype move: family resemblance structure with central/peripheral members.
- The “count basin” (attractor) metaphor is isomorphic to a typicality gradient: distance from the basin’s center ≈ degree of membership/typicality.
- The chapter’s appeal to intermediate categories (quasi-count nouns) mirrors the long-standing point that categories often have **graded membership** and **borderline cases** rather than crisp necessary-and-sufficient criteria.

### What HPC adds (and should be stated explicitly to avoid wheel-reinvention)
Prototype theory is primarily a *descriptive* account of category structure and cognitive effects (typicality, graded membership, family resemblance). Your HPC framing can add two things that prototype theory (as usually presented) does not foreground:
1. **Why correlations exist:** a “homeostasis” story—mechanisms that keep properties traveling together rather than drifting apart.
2. **Intervention-style predictions:** how the cluster should degrade under perturbations (diachrony; cross-linguistic packaging changes), and why *this* graded structure has *this* particular geometry (tight-before-loose).

If you say this directly, you pre-empt the natural reaction from categorization researchers: “Yes—prototypes and gradience. What’s the extra explanatory work?”

### A caution: avoid setting up prototype theory as a straw target
The claim that “no version of prototype theory explains why the gradience has this particular shape” is rhetorically tempting but potentially unfair. Prototype theory was never intended as a theory of *morphosyntactic implicational scales*. A better contrast is:
- Prototype theory: predicts gradedness/typicality and differential cue weighting in general.
- Your account: predicts a *specific* implicational ordering in the grammar (tight-before-loose) *because* constructions impose different precision demands and the grammar repeatedly reinforces those demands.

### Concrete revision suggestion
Add a short “Relation to prototype theory” paragraph near the first explicit use of “prototype” (in the individuation section) that:
- acknowledges prototype structure as familiar,
- identifies the HPC contribution as a mechanism story for maintaining (and perturbing) that structure,
- and explicitly maps terms: **prototype/typicality ↔ basin center**, **graded membership ↔ basin geometry**, **cue validity/feature weights ↔ lock tolerances**.

## (2) Is the “individuation cluster” appropriately grounded in cognitive science?

### Strengths
- Anchoring boundedness/atomicity in object perception (edge detection, object files, persistence across occlusion) and early competence (Spelke-style “core knowledge”) is a plausible cognitive foundation for *individuation as a construal resource*.
- Cross-modal binding is a good point: “one object with multimodal properties” is exactly the kind of mechanism that yields stable object representations and, by extension, stable candidates for “atoms.”
- The acquisition discussion (children overgeneralizing from one count cue to others) fits well with a learning system that treats morphosyntax as probabilistic evidence about individuation.

### Places the grounding feels overextended or under-bridged
- The macrophage analogy (self/non-self “edge detection”) is clever, but it risks looking like rhetorical flourish rather than cognitive grounding. Because it lives outside the cognitive/perceptual literature, it may distract from the core claim unless you make the computational analogy do real explanatory work (or trim it).
- The bridge from formal-semantic “atoms accessible to quantification” to cognitive mechanisms would benefit from one extra step: *what counts as a cognitive unit* for quantification and tracking, and how that interacts with language (e.g., object tracking limits; subitizing; the distinction between individuating vs measuring).
- The four-property cluster (boundedness, atomicity, enumerability, homogeneity-resistance) is plausible, but it would read as better grounded if you connect each property to a recognizable empirical handle (even briefly): which tasks/phenomena show it, which developmental timelines support it, and where dissociations are known.

### What would strengthen this section with minimal disruption
- Tighten the cognitive story around **object individuation + numerical cognition**: the same mechanisms that give you “objects” also constrain how easy exact counting is, which dovetails with your “precision lock” hierarchy.
- Be careful with “these are the same properties” language when aligning infant object knowledge with your four-property list. The overlap is real for boundedness/cohesion/continuity, but enumerability and homogeneity-resistance are not straightforwardly identical to the classic infant object principles; readers may push back on that equivalence.
- Consider explicitly distinguishing **perceptual individuation** (segmentation, tracking) from **linguistic/conceptual individuation** (construal and conventional packaging). You already gesture at this with *furniture* and cross-linguistic variation; making it explicit would prevent a naïve “ontology → grammar” reading.

## (3) What is genuinely new here vs. familiar from categorization research?

### Familiar (and should be acknowledged as such)
- Graded category structure with prototypes and borderline cases.
- Clusters of correlated cues rather than single defining features.
- Typicality-like “center vs periphery” geometry (your basin metaphor).
- The idea that learning and frequency/entrenchment shape category stability.

### Genuinely additive (where your chapter feels most valuable)
- **Coupling two clusters** (semantic individuation + morphosyntactic count cues) as the unit of analysis, with a bidirectional inference mechanism as the “glue.” This is a clean way to connect conceptual structure to grammar without reducing one to the other.
- **A specific implicational prediction**: tight properties should fail before loose ones, yielding the triangular distribution. This is more than “gradedness exists”; it is a *shaped* gradience claim.
- **Functional anchoring** as an explanation for why some borderline categories stabilize (e.g., *cattle/police*) and others wobble (e.g., *folks*)—this is a nice, ecologically realistic stabilizer.
- **Natural-experiment logic** (“ablation by perturbation”) that treats typological variation as evidence about mechanism sensitivity, with explicit disconfirmation conditions. That’s an unusually cognitive-science-friendly methodological stance for a grammar chapter.

### Where novelty risks being overstated
- The “cluster of morphosyntactic diagnostics” for count/mass is already standard in grammar descriptions, and intermediate classes (object-mass, pluralia tantum, quasi-count) are well-known. Your contribution is not their discovery but their unification under a mechanism-sensitive maintenance story.
- Diachronic stories like *pea* reanalysis and *data* drift are compelling, but they will land as “usage + analogy + competition” unless you explicitly tie them back to the predicted *order* of cluster completion/erosion (outside-in vs inside-out), which is where the HPC framing earns its keep.

## One high-level suggestion

Add a brief “What’s new relative to prototype theory” box/paragraph that says:
- Prototype effects describe the graded structure; HPC identifies why the structure is stable and projectible (and how it breaks).
- The key testable payoff is the *implicational hierarchy* and the *mechanism-sensitive perturbation predictions* (diachrony; cross-linguistic packaging).

That single move would make the chapter feel less like a rebranding of prototype structure and more like an integration of categorization research with a principled account of grammatical maintenance.
