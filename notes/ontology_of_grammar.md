# The Ontology of Grammar: Feature Systems, Lexical Categories, and the Boundary of Natural Kinds

## 1. Introduction: The Metaphysical Anxiety of Linguistics

The intellectual history of linguistics is, in many respects, a history of classification anxiety. From the moment the earliest grammarians in ancient India and Greece attempted to dissect the stream of speech into discrete units, the discipline has been haunted by a fundamental metaphysical question: Do the categories we use to describe language—Noun, Verb, Gender, Case, Tense—correspond to objective "natural kinds" inherent in the architecture of the human mind or the biological reality of the speaker? Or are they, conversely, "descriptive artifacts"—convenient fictions imposed by the analyst to bring order to chaotic data? This tension between Realism (the belief that linguistic categories exist independent of observation) and Nominalism (the belief that categories are names we give to observed patterns) constitutes the core ontological debate of the field.

This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the depth of ontological and categorization debates surrounding grammatical features and systems (such as gender, number, person, and aspect) compared to those surrounding lexical categories (parts of speech). While the classification of words into categories like "Noun" and "Verb" has historically served as the primary entry point for grammatical analysis, contemporary theoretical linguistics has seen the most intense boundary disputes shift toward the "atomic" level of grammatical features. The distinction between a "noun" and a "verb," while occasionally porous and subject to typological variation, is often treated as a fundamental, perhaps even universal, dichotomy in many generative and functional frameworks.

In contrast, the ontological status of features like "gender" or "tense" is fraught with profound instability. Theoretical linguistics is currently witnessing a fracturing of these traditional pillars. Is gender a distinct category, or is it merely a sub-routine of the number system—a mechanism for individuation rather than classification? Is tense a primitive of the human mind, or is it a derivative of aspectual event structure? Are these features "natural kinds" rooted in a Universal Grammar (UG), or are they "comparative concepts" that have no psychological reality within the mind of the speaker?

The analysis proceeds by first examining the historical and theoretical foundations of lexical categorization, establishing the baseline against which feature debates can be measured. It then descends into the "atomic" world of functional features, exploring the radical reductionist hypotheses that seek to collapse Gender into Number, Tense into Aspect, and Person into Spatial Deixis. Finally, it addresses the meta-theoretical conflict between the Generative tradition, which views features as innate biological realities (Interpretable Features), and the Typological tradition, which views them as methodological constructs (Comparative Concepts). The evidence suggests that while lexical category debates are largely distinct taxonomic disputes, grammatical feature debates are existential and architectural disputes, probing the very nature of human cognition and the limits of biological determination in language.

### 1.1 The Shift from Taxonomy to Architecture

In the classical traditions, grammar was primarily a taxonomic enterprise. The goal was to identify the "parts of speech" (Greek merē logou, Latin partes orationis) and list their accidents (inflections). The ontology was assumed to be relatively flat: a word "had" gender in the same way it "had" a sound. However, the generative revolution and the subsequent rise of feature geometry and cartography changed the terrain of the debate. Language was no longer seen as a string of words but as a hierarchical structure of abstract features.

This shift relocated the "natural kind" debate. If the word is no longer the atom of language, but rather a molecule built from smaller atomic features (roots, functional heads), then the ontological weight falls on those features. A "Noun" ceases to be a primitive; it becomes a derived structure ($n$ + $\sqrt{root}$). Consequently, the debate over "what is a noun" is resolved by structural definition. But the debate over "what is gender" intensifies, because gender remains a feature within that structure. If we cannot agree on the inventory of these atomic features, we cannot agree on the fundamental building blocks of the language faculty.

### 1.2 Defining the Scope: Natural Kinds vs. Artifacts

Central to this report is the distinction between Natural Kinds and Artifacts, a distinction borrowed from philosophy and cognitive science.

**Natural Kinds:** Entities that exist in nature independent of human intent, possessing an internal "essence" that dictates their properties (e.g., gold, tiger, electron). In linguistics, a "Natural Kind" would be a category like Person or Number if it is hard-wired into the human brain by genetics (Universal Grammar).

**Artifacts:** Entities created by human intent to serve a function, defined by their use rather than an internal essence (e.g., chair, hammer, government). In linguistics, a category is an "Artifact" if it is a cultural evolution or a descriptive tool created by linguists to compare languages (e.g., "The Dative Case" as a label for various recipient-marking strategies).

The tension between these two views drives the boundary disputes discussed below. Generative linguists tend to defend the Natural Kind status of features to support the hypothesis of an innate language faculty. Typologists and functionalists tend to view linguistic categories as Artifacts (or "Comparative Concepts") to account for the immense variability of human languages.

## 2. The Ontology of Lexical Categories: A Historical and Theoretical Baseline

To understand the volatility of current feature debates, one must first establish the historical depth and relative stability of lexical categorization. The division of the lexicon into categories—primarily Noun (N) and Verb (V)—is one of the oldest and most robust assumptions in linguistics, spanning millennia and diverse intellectual traditions.

### 2.1 The Universality of the Noun-Verb Distinction

The distinction between Noun and Verb is arguably the strongest candidate for a linguistic "natural kind." It appears to correlate, albeit imperfectly, with the ontological distinction between "objects" (time-stable entities) and "events" (time-unstable entities) in the physical world. This semantic bootstrapping suggests that the N/V distinction is cognitively primordial.

#### 2.1.1 The Classical Traditions

**Sanskrit (Indian) Tradition:** As early as the 5th century BC, Yāska and Pāṇini distinguished between nāman (noun) and ākhyāta (verb). Yāska explicitly defined them semantically: nouns are words where "being" is fundamental, while verbs are words where "becoming" (process) is fundamental. This arguably predates the Greek tradition in identifying the ontological basis of the distinction.

**Greek and Roman Tradition:** Plato distinguished onoma (noun/subject) and rhema (verb/predicate). Aristotle expanded this, and the Alexandrian grammarians (Dionysius Thrax) eventually codified eight parts of speech. The Roman tradition (Varro, Donatus, Priscian) adopted this system almost wholesale, cementing the "parts of speech" as the foundation of Western grammar.

**Arabic and Hebrew Tradition:** The Semitic grammatical tradition (e.g., Sibawayh, Ibn Janach) generally recognized a tripartite division: ism (noun), fi'l (verb), and harf (particle). This strictly limited ontology (three parts of speech) contrasts with the eight or nine of the Western tradition but upholds the primacy of the N/V split.

#### 2.1.2 The "Squish" and Mixed Categories

Despite this historical consensus, the ontology of lexical categories is not without its "boundary disputes." The concept of "mixed categories"—items that display properties of both nouns and verbs—has always troubled taxonomists.

**Gerunds and Participles:** In English, a gerund like "singing" in "John's singing of the anthem" has nominal distribution (it takes a genitive subject and prepositional object) but verbal semantics. Is it a Noun or a Verb?

**Adjectives as a Non-Universal Category:** While N and V are near-universal, the Adjective class is frequently contested. Many languages (e.g., Lao, various Bantu languages) function with a closed or non-existent adjective class, using stative verbs ("to be red") or nominal constructions ("person of strength") instead. This suggests that "Adjective" may not be a natural kind in the same deep sense as N and V, but rather a derived or optional category.

### 2.2 The Generative Turn: Decomposition of the Word

In the generative tradition, particularly within the Principles and Parameters framework, lexical categories were initially treated as bundles of binary features, such as $[\pm N, \pm V]$. Nouns were $[+N, -V]$, Verbs were $[-N, +V]$, Adjectives were $[+N, +V]$, and Prepositions were $[-N, -V]$. This reductionist approach attempted to ground the ontology of parts of speech in a small set of primitives.

However, the most significant ontological shift occurred with the advent of Distributed Morphology (DM). In DM, the "lexical item" is deconstructed. The theory posits that the "root" ($\sqrt{}$) is entirely category-neutral, devoid of inherent nominal or verbal properties.

**The Structural Definition:** A "noun" is not a primitive of the system; rather, it is a structural configuration—a root merged with a "little n" ($n$) functional head. A "verb" is a root merged with a "little v" ($v$) head.

**Ontological Consequence:** This shift moves the ontological weight away from the word and onto the functional architecture. If a "noun" is simply any root dominated by $n$, then the debate over lexical categories effectively ends or transforms. The "natural kind" is not the lexical item "cat," but the functional head $n$ that categorizes it. This effectively resolves the "boundary disputes" of mixed categories by analyzing them as multi-layered structures (e.g., a root merged with $v$, then subsequently merged with $n$ to form a gerund).

### 2.3 Typological Skepticism: The "Comparative Concept" of the Noun

While Generative theory dissolved the category into structure, Typological theory dissolved it into methodology. Martin Haspelmath and William Croft have argued that "Noun" and "Verb" are not cross-linguistic natural kinds.

**The Argument:** Haspelmath argues that descriptive categories are language-specific and incommensurable. "Noun in English" is defined by specific distributional criteria (pluralization, determiners). "Noun in Japanese" is defined by different criteria (case markers, lack of plural inflection). Therefore, "Noun" is not a universal entity but a Comparative Concept—a tool created by linguists to group functionally similar phenomena.

**The Implication:** This view denies the "Natural Kind" status of lexical categories across languages. It suggests that while every language may solve the problem of referring to objects and events, they do so with unique, evolving artifacts, not by accessing a Platonic "Noun" category.

## 3. The Ontology of Grammatical Features: The "Gender" Complex

When we descend from the level of the word to the level of the grammatical feature—Gender, Number, Person, Case—the debates become significantly more abstract and structurally complex. Here, the boundary disputes are not just about classification but about reducibility: Can one feature be reduced to another? Is Gender actually Number? Is Animacy a separate dimension or the core of Gender?

### 3.1 The "Gender is Number" Hypothesis

One of the most illuminating and radical case studies in the ontology of grammatical features is the relationship between Gender and Number. Traditionally, these are treated as distinct, orthogonal categories: Number deals with quantity (singular/plural), and Gender deals with classification (masculine/feminine/neuter). However, deeper research suggests a profound boundary dispute.

#### 3.1.1 The Theoretical Argument (Picallo & Lowenstamm)

Research by Picallo (1991, 2008) and Lowenstamm (2008) challenges the autonomy of gender. Picallo argues that gender on nouns is not a functional feature in the same way number is. Instead, "gender" is often the exponent of a Class feature that allows a noun to be individuated.

**The Mechanism of Individuation:** In many languages, a "bare" root cannot be counted. It represents a mass or a concept (e.g., "cat-ness"). To be counted (to have Number), it must first be instantiated as a specific type of thing. "Gender" markers often fulfill this function of instantiation.

**Derivational vs. Inflectional:** Lowenstamm argues that gender markers are often derivational suffixes (roots in their own right) that define the category, rather than inflectional accidents. If gender is derivational and number is inflectional, they occupy different places in the ontology of the word, but Gender serves the purpose of enabling Number.

**Reductionism:** Under this view, "Gender" is reducible to "Class," which is a prerequisite for "Individuation" (Number). This collapses the traditional distinction and suggests that what we call "gender" is actually part of the machinery of individuation—a sub-component of the Number system.

#### 3.1.2 Empirical Evidence: The Collapse in the Plural

The "Gender is Number" hypothesis is supported by robust typological evidence.

**Greenberg's Universal 37:** "A language never has more gender categories in non-singular numbers than in the singular".

**Neutralization:** In many languages (e.g., Russian, German adjectives), gender distinctions collapse entirely in the plural.

**Interpretation:** If the function of Gender is to specify a "unit" so it can be counted, then once the noun is Plural (i.e., it has already been counted), the Gender function is satisfied or rendered redundant. The plural marker "overwrites" the need for the singulative/classifying gender marker. This implies an ontological dependency: Number dominates Gender.

### 3.2 Gender vs. Classifiers: A False Dichotomy?

The debate is further complicated by the relationship between grammatical gender and numeral classifiers. Traditionally, languages are split into "gender languages" (like Spanish, where nouns have inherent gender) and "classifier languages" (like Chinese, where nouns require a separate word to be counted).

**The Boundary Dispute:** Recent typology suggests this is a false dichotomy. Some languages have both systems, and the functions overlap significantly. Both systems serve to categorize nouns, and both often interact with number.

**Ontological Implications:** If gender and classifiers perform the same function (individuating nouns so they can be counted), they may be manifestations of the same underlying "natural kind"—a Nominal Classification feature. The difference is merely one of realization (affix vs. free morpheme) rather than deep ontology.

**Mass/Count Semantics:** The distinction between mass nouns and count nouns is the semantic substrate for this debate. Mass nouns are seen as the default state of nominals; "Class" (Gender/Classifiers) is the operator that turns them into Count nouns. This supports the view that Gender is not fundamentally about "sex" (a biological property) or "arbitrary class" (a cultural artifact), but about Atomicity (a logical property).

### 3.3 Animacy: The Hidden Driver

In many languages, what looks like "Gender" is actually "Animacy."

**Algonquian Languages:** In languages like Blackfoot and Ojibwe, the primary distinction is Animate vs. Inanimate. This distinction drives the plural morphology and verbal agreement.

**Ontological Status:** Ritter and Wiltschko argue that Animacy interacts with the "Universal Spine" of the noun phrase. In these languages, Animacy is not just a semantic feature but a syntactic one that determines the very structure of the DP. This suggests that "Gender" (as purely arbitrary class) might be a degraded or fossilized form of "Animacy" (a biologically grounded natural kind).

## 4. The Ontology of Grammatical Features: The "TAM" and "Person" Complexes

The second major arena of ontological dispute concerns the relationship between Tense, Aspect, and Modality (TAM), as well as the nature of Person. These debates challenge the notion that Tense and Person are primitives of Universal Grammar.

### 4.1 The Tense-Aspect Wars: Ontological Priority

Traditional grammar treats Tense (location in time) and Aspect (internal shape of the event) as separate pillars of verbal morphology. However, theoretical linguistics has increasingly questioned the natural kind status of Tense, often attempting to reduce it to Aspect.

#### 4.1.1 The "Tense is Aspect" Hypothesis

There is a strong theoretical current suggesting that Aspect is ontologically prior to Tense.

**Cognitive Evidence:** Psycholinguistic evidence suggests that children acquire aspectual distinctions (completed vs. ongoing) before they acquire tense distinctions (past vs. non-past). This hints that Aspect might be a more fundamental cognitive category—a true natural kind—while Tense is a later, more abstract construction.

**Theoretical Reduction:** Some scholars argue that Tense is merely "Aspect localized in time" or a subcategory of Aspect. In this view, the "Perfect" (often treated as a tense) is actually an aspectual viewpoint that happens to have temporal implications (a past action with current relevance).

**Tenseless Languages:** The existence of "tenseless" languages (e.g., Chinese, certain Amazonian languages) forces the question: Is Tense a universal category? If a language lacks morphological tense, does it still have a "Tense" feature in its ontology?

#### 4.1.2 The Universal Spine: INFL as a Variable Category

Ritter and Wiltschko (2009, 2014) propose a radical restructuring of the ontology of TAM. They argue against a universal "Tense Phrase" (TP). Instead, they posit a universal Anchoring Category (INFL).

**The Mechanism:** This Anchoring Category must link the event to the utterance context.

**Variation as Ontology:** The crucial insight is that the content of this category varies. In English, INFL is filled by Tense (anchoring via time). In Halkomelem (Salish), the anchoring is spatial/deictic (Location). In Blackfoot, the anchoring is participant-based (Person).

**Resolution:** This resolves the ontological dispute by shifting the "natural kind" status up a level. "Tense" is not the natural kind; "Anchoring" is the natural kind. Tense is just one possible value for that category. This contrasts with the Cinque Hierarchy, which assumes Tense is always present in a fixed hierarchy, even if covert.

### 4.2 Person: Spatial Deixis or Grammatical Feature?

The category of "Person" (1st, 2nd, 3rd) offers a third crucial boundary dispute. Is Person a grammatical feature like Number, or is it an intrusion of the "real world" (deixis) into the syntax?

#### 4.2.1 Person as Spatial Deixis

Standard definitions of Person refer to "Speaker," "Addressee," and "Other." However, deep research suggests that Person systems may be reducible to, or at least derived from, spatial deixis systems.

**The Argument:** Pronouns like "I" and "You" function identically to "Here" and "There." They orient the discourse relative to an "Origo" (center).

**Reduction:** Some analyses attempt to reduce Person to spatial coordinates, treating the "1st Person" as [+proximate] and "3rd Person" as [-proximate]. If this is true, then "Person" is not a linguistic primitive but a spatial-cognitive one recruited by language. This aligns with the "Localist Hypothesis" in case grammar, which posits that abstract grammatical relations are derived from spatial ones.

#### 4.2.2 The "Person is Number" Controversy

While some argue Person is Deixis, others argue for a "Person is Number" view—or at least that they are inextricably linked.

**The Plurality of "We":** "We" is rarely just "plural I" (Speaker + Speaker + Speaker). It is usually "Speaker + Others." This suggests that "plurality" in the domain of Person is ontologically distinct from "plurality" in the domain of objects (three apples).

**Harbour's Partition Theory:** Daniel Harbour proposes that Person is not a set of features but a Partition of the discourse space (Author, Participant, Other). This mathematical approach attempts to strip the "sociological" baggage from the feature and treat it as a pure logical operation. Crucially, Harbour argues that Person is "number-indifferent," meaning that the features $[\pm Author]$ and $[\pm Participant]$ operate independently of singular/plural calculations, creating a lattice of possible pronouns.

## 5. The Meta-Debate: Natural Kinds vs. Comparative Concepts

Connecting all these specific feature disputes is the overarching meta-theoretical debate concerning Natural Kinds. This debate strikes at the heart of how linguistic research is conducted and what it claims to discover.

### 5.1 Realism: The Interpretable Feature (Generative Tradition)

Generative linguistics (Chomsky, Cinque, Harley) generally operates on a Realist assumption: Grammatical features (Tense, Case, Gender) are Interpretable Features in the mind. They are biological/cognitive realities—natural kinds.

**The Generative View:** When we see "Dative" in German and "Dative" in Latin, we are seeing the same mental object (Case) realized slightly differently. The goal is to map the geometry of these natural kinds. The Cinque Hierarchy is the ultimate expression of this view: a fixed, universal sequence of functional heads (Mood > Modality > Tense > Aspect) that exists in every human brain.

**Ontological Claim:** Under this view, if a language appears to lack "Tense," it is merely because the Tense feature is phonologically null, not because the category is absent from the ontology.

### 5.2 Nominalism: The Comparative Concept (Typological Tradition)

Typological linguistics (Haspelmath, Croft, Dryer) increasingly operates on a Nominalist assumption: Cross-linguistic categories are Comparative Concepts. They are constructs created by linguists to compare languages, but they have no psychological reality in the speaker.

**The Typological View:** "Dative" in German is a Descriptive Category specific to German syntax. "Dative" in Latin is specific to Latin syntax. We can compare them using a "Comparative Concept" of Dative (e.g., "marker of the recipient"), but we cannot say they are the same thing.

**The Critique of Natural Kinds:** Haspelmath argues that linguistics has no "periodic table." There is no fixed set of atomic features provided by nature. Instead, languages evolve categories culturally, and they converge on similar functions due to functional pressure (communicative efficiency), not innate templates. This view challenges the entire enterprise of "Feature Geometry" as a mapping of artifacts, not minds.

### 5.3 Cognitive Science: Artifacts vs. Natural Kinds

This linguistic debate mirrors the distinction in cognitive science between "Natural Kinds" and "Artifacts."

**Grammar as Artifact:** If grammatical features are artifacts (tools evolved for communication), then we should expect them to have "associated events" (functions) but not "essences". This supports the functionalist/typological view.

**Grammar as Natural Kind:** If grammatical features are natural kinds (like chemical elements), we should expect rigid boundaries and universal hierarchies. This supports the generative/cartographic view. The persistence of "unexpected" patterns (like the "Universal 37" on gender/number interaction) serves as evidence for the Natural Kind status, as functionalism struggles to explain why arbitrary constraints would exist universally.

**Research on Children:** Studies show that children distinguish between artifacts (which can be altered) and natural kinds (which have essences) at a young age. The question remains: Do children treat "Noun" and "Verb" like "Cat" and "Dog" (natural) or like "Chair" and "Table" (functional)? The semantic bootstrapping hypothesis suggests the former.

### 5.4 The Canonical Approach: A Middle Way?

Greville Corbett's Canonical Typology offers a potential resolution. Instead of asking if a feature is "real" or "universal" in a binary sense, it defines a theoretical Canon (an ideal version of the feature) and measures how much real languages deviate from it.

**Application:** We can define "Canonical Gender". A language might have a non-canonical system that looks a bit like gender and a bit like classifiers. We don't need to force it into a binary box.

**Ontology:** This approach treats the center of the category as a stable concept (possibly a natural kind or a functional attractor) but accepts that the periphery is fuzzy and language-specific. It bridges the gap between the rigid Realism of generativism and the chaotic Nominalism of extreme typology.

## 6. Comparative Analysis: Depth of Debates

The core requirement of this report is to compare the depth of ontological debates between lexical categories and grammatical features.

### 6.1 The "Shallowness" of Lexical Category Debates

Debates surrounding lexical categories (Noun vs. Verb) are fundamentally taxonomic.

**The Question:** "Is this specific word in this specific language a noun or a verb?"

**The Resolution:** Most theories agree on the existence of the categories N and V, even if they disagree on the specific membership of "mixed" items. The move to Distributed Morphology has largely "solved" the ontological problem by defining categories structurally ($n$ vs. $v$).

**Stability:** The N/V distinction is robust across traditions (Sanskrit, Greek, Generative, Typological) and time. It is a foundational assumption that is rarely threatened with elimination.

### 6.2 The "Depth" of Feature Debates

Debates surrounding grammatical features (Gender, Tense, Person) are fundamentally existential and architectural.

**The Question:** "Does 'Gender' exist, or is it just 'Number'? Does 'Tense' exist, or is it just 'Aspect'?"

**The Instability:** There is no consensus on the inventory of features. The "Gender is Number" and "Person is Deixis" debates suggest that entire categories could be illusions or reducible sub-routines.

**Architectural Implication:** These debates implicate the structure of the mind itself. If Tense is not a natural kind, then the "Universal Grammar" looks very different than if Tense is a fixed head in the Cinque Hierarchy. The debate is not just about labeling data; it is about mapping the "Universal Spine" of human cognition.

### 6.3 Table 1: Comparative Landscape of Ontological Debates

| Domain | Key "Natural Kind" Candidates | Major Boundary Dispute | Theoretical Outcome | Depth of Debate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lexical Categories** | Noun, Verb | Mixed Categories: Are gerunds N or V? Are Adjectives real? | Distributed Morphology: Roots are neutral; Syntax creates categories ($n$, $v$). | **Taxonomic:** High consensus on core categories; dispute is over boundary cases. |
| **Gender** | Class, Animacy | Gender vs. Number: Is Gender just a prerequisite for counting (Number)? | Unified Nominal Spine: Gender is "Class," required for "Individuation" (Number). | **Existential:** Questioning the autonomy of the category itself. |
| **TAM** | Tense, Aspect, Event | Tense vs. Aspect: Is Tense just "Aspect localized in time"? | Universal Spine (Wiltschko): "Anchoring" is universal; Tense is a language-specific value. | **Architectural:** Redefining the universal components of the clause. |
| **Person** | Participant, Author | Person vs. Deixis: Is Person just spatial orientation (proximate/distal)? | Harbour's Partition: Person is a logical partition of space, distinct from Number. | **Reductionist:** Reducing grammar to spatial/logical cognition. |

## 7. Conclusion

The research demonstrates that the ontological and categorization debates surrounding grammatical features are significantly deeper, more contentious, and more consequential for linguistic theory than those surrounding lexical categories.

While lexical categories have been successfully deconstructed by theories like Distributed Morphology—reducing them to structural configurations of roots—grammatical features resist such easy reduction. The debates over whether Gender is a manifestation of Number, whether Tense is a sub-routine of Aspect, or whether Person is a form of spatial Deixis, suggest that the "atoms" of grammar are not yet identified. The field is essentially debating the "Periodic Table" of linguistics, and unlike chemistry, there is no consensus on the elements.

Furthermore, the "Natural Kind" status of these features remains the central fault line between the two dominant traditions in linguistics. The Generative tradition requires features to be Natural Kinds (innate, interpretable, geometric) to sustain the hypothesis of Universal Grammar. The Typological tradition, represented by Haspelmath's "Comparative Concepts," argues that these features are descriptive artifacts with no cross-linguistic ontological reality.

The evidence points toward a "Decompositional" future for the field: "Tense" and "Gender" are likely not the primitives. Instead, more abstract primitives—such as Individuation (underlying Number/Gender), Anchoring (underlying Tense/Person), and Partition (underlying Person/Deixis)—appear to be the true candidates for the Natural Kinds of human language. These deeper, abstract primitives may finally bridge the gap between the biological reality of the brain and the typological diversity of the world's languages.
