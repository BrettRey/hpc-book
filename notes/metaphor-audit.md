# Metaphor Audit: "Words That Won't Hold Still"

Based on comprehensive extraction from all 15 chapters, here is my evaluation of the book's metaphor system.

---
## Tier 1: Load-Bearing Metaphors (Essential — Extend)

These metaphors do conceptual heavy lifting and should be reinforced throughout.

| Metaphor | Chapters | Strength | Value | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standing wave / spinning top** | 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 | Very strong | Conveys core thesis: stability from dynamics, not stasis | **Extend.** Currently strong but could anchor Part IV more explicitly. The wave-form image captures HPC ontology better than any alternative. |
| **Basin / attractor / valley** | 4, 5, 7, 9 | Very strong | Makes feature-space topology intuitive; supports gradient membership | **Extend.** Could unify countability (Ch 9), definiteness (Ch 10), and pro-form gender (Ch 12) more explicitly. "Wobbling in the basin" is excellent. |
| **Phase transitions (water/ice)** | 3, 5 | Very strong | Explains discreteness without essences; empirically grounded | **Extend cautiously.** Central to Ch 5; could be referenced in Ch 13's transparency discussion. Risk: over-reliance on physics analogy. |
| **Zipper (form–value coupling)** | 13 | Excellent | Novel; structures entire chapter; explains failure modes (slips, jams, misalignment) | **Extend into Part IV conclusion.** Currently concentrated in Ch 13. Brief callbacks in Ch 14/15 would provide structural closure. |
| **Convergent evolution (sharks/ dolphins/ ichthyosaurs)** | 2, 11 | Very strong | Explains braided mechanisms; surface similarity from independent causes | **Maintain.** Well-developed. The extension to pronouns in Ch 11 is particularly effective. |

## Tier 2: Strong Metaphors (Effective — Maintain or Extend Selectively)

**Metaphor: Lock-and-key hierarchy**
- **Chapters**: 9
- **Strength**: Strong
- **Value**: Explains graded property accessibility in countability
- **Recommendation**: Maintain within chapter. Well-integrated with basin metaphor. Extending to other chapters risks overgeneralizing.

**Metaphor: Volcano / volcanic island**
- **Chapters**: 6, 7
- **Strength**: Strong
- **Value**: Explains mechanism drift; history ≠ synchrony
- **Recommendation**: Maintain. Vivid and philosophically precise. The "dormant volcano, live coral" image is excellent.

**Metaphor: Wastebasket / filing cabinet**
- **Chapters**: 3, 8, 11
- **Strength**: Strong
- **Value**: Diagnoses convenience classes masquerading as kinds
- **Recommendation**: Extend slightly. Could recur in Ch 14 (grammaticality as wastebasket risk?) but use sparingly.

**Metaphor: Smoke ring**
- **Chapters**: 7, 8
- **Strength**: Strong
- **Value**: Captures thin clusters—structure without substance
- **Recommendation**: Maintain. The ephemeral-but-structured image is hard to replace.

**Metaphor: Family portraits vs. passport photos**
- **Chapters**: 1
- **Strength**: Excellent
- **Value**: Captures prototype vs. definition distinction
- **Recommendation**: Extend. Used only once (Ch 1, line 103). Could recur in Ch 14 when discussing grammaticality judgments.

**Metaphor: Turkey parable (Liu Cixin)**
- **Chapters**: 6
- **Strength**: Strong
- **Value**: Illustrates induction failure without mechanisms
- **Recommendation**: Maintain. Philosophically pivotal but self-contained.

**Metaphor: Good bet / pedicab**
- **Chapters**: 6
- **Strength**: Strong
- **Value**: Frames projectibility as practical wager
- **Recommendation**: Maintain. Anchors Ch 6 effectively.

**Metaphor: Federalism / territories / borders**
- **Chapters**: 15
- **Strength**: Strong
- **Value**: Reframes disciplinary structure
- **Recommendation**: Develop further as Ch 15 completes. The shift from "borders" to "contact zones" is valuable.

---
## Tier 3: Moderate Metaphors (Useful — Maintain or Reduce)

**Metaphor: Macrophage**
- **Chapters**: 7
- **Strength**: Moderate
- **Value**: Provides biological parallel for cluster-first method
- **Recommendation**: Maintain but don't extend. Works locally but risks technical jargon.

**Metaphor: Sourdough starter**
- **Chapters**: 7
- **Strength**: Good
- **Value**: Captures reciprocal maintenance
- **Recommendation**: Maintain. Memorable and domestic—provides accessibility.

**Metaphor: Madagascar fauna**
- **Chapters**: 8
- **Strength**: Moderate
- **Value**: Distinguishes ecosystem from species
- **Recommendation**: Maintain. Important for grain question but used effectively in one place.

**Metaphor: Anatomist's table / skeleton / plumage**
- **Chapters**: 11
- **Strength**: Good
- **Value**: Organizes Ch 11's structure
- **Recommendation**: Maintain within chapter. The skeleton/plumage distinction for nouns-verbs vs. adjectives is effective.

**Metaphor: LEGO trademark battle**
- **Chapters**: 9
- **Strength**: Good
- **Value**: Frames prescriptive vs. structural pressure
- **Recommendation**: Maintain. Accessible and current.

**Metaphor: Bundles / overlap**
- **Chapters**: 10, 15
- **Strength**: Moderate
- **Value**: Frames form–value decoupling and disciplinary HPC
- **Recommendation**: Develop in Ch 15. Currently underused; could tie Part IV together.

**Metaphor: Proper function / derived function**
- **Chapters**: 10
- **Strength**: Moderate
- **Value**: Explains grammaticalization and parasitic uses
- **Recommendation**: Maintain. Technical but necessary for the definiteness chapter.

## Tier 4: Thin or Underused Metaphors (Consider Reducing or Developing)

| Metaphor | Chapters | Issue | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Riverbed carved by flow** | 7 | Used once; could be stronger | **Extend or drop.** Either develop as a usage-based metaphor or cut—it competes with the basin image. |
| **Trail in the woods** | 7, 8 | Used twice | **Reduce to one.** Overlaps with riverbed. Choose one "path-worn-by-walking" metaphor. |
| **Snow-covered rails** | 5 | Used once | **Reduce.** Redundant with phase transitions. The rails add little that ice doesn't. |
| **Edge detection / Gabor filters** | 9 | Technical | **Maintain but explain more.** Excellent grounding but may lose non-technical readers. |
| **Perceptual magnets** | 13 | Technical term (Kuhl) | **Maintain with citation.** Does real work but could use one sentence of unpacking. |
| **Looping intensity** | 13 | Used once | **Develop or drop.** The reflexivity idea is important but "looping" competes with zipper and basin. |
| **Entanglement** | 15 | Quantum metaphor | **Reduce or rephrase.** "Entanglement" imports quantum connotations that may mislead. "Interwoven" or "braided" does the same work. |

---
## Tier 5: Metaphors to Avoid or Revise

**Metaphor: "Joints" (carving at joints)**
- **Issue**: Platonic origin; imports essentialism
- **Recommendation**: Use sparingly and with irony. Currently appears in Ch 1 and 3. The metaphor is Plato's, and the book argues against carving kinds from essences. Either flag the irony or reduce.

**Metaphor: "Boxes"**
- **Issue**: Container metaphor; suggests membership is binary
- **Recommendation**: Reduce or reframe. Appears frequently but potentially undermines gradient-membership claims. Use "basins" instead.

**Metaphor: "Tree-like structure"**
- **Issue**: Ch 15 critique
- **Recommendation**: Keep only as diagnosis. The book argues against tree structures; don't accidentally deploy the metaphor positively elsewhere.

## Cross-Book Metaphor Coherence

**Strengths:**
- The spinning-top → basin → phase-transition → standing-wave chain is internally consistent. These are all dynamic-systems metaphors that reinforce the core thesis.
- The zipper metaphor (Ch 13) complements rather than competes with the basin metaphor—zipper addresses form–value coupling, basin addresses membership gradience.
- The biological metaphors (macrophage, Madagascar, convergent evolution) share a family resemblance: mechanisms produce kinds without design.

**Gaps:**
1.  **Part III (Ch 9–12)** lacks a unifying metaphor. Each chapter has local metaphors (lock-and-key, form–value quadrant, skeleton/plumage, maintenance spectrum), but no single image ties the four case studies together. Consider a brief "returning to the basin" framing at the start of Part III.
2.  **Part IV (Ch 13–15)** shifts metaphor families: Ch 13 uses physical metaphors (zipper, coupling), Ch 15 uses political metaphors (federalism, territories). This may be intentional (different levels require different frames), but a brief acknowledgment of the shift would help.
3.  **Grammaticality (Ch 14)** is a placeholder. This is the book's central empirical domain. The metaphor choice here will matter enormously. Recommendation: lean into the standing-wave/basin metaphors rather than introducing new ones.

## Final Assessment

The book's metaphor system is strong and philosophically disciplined. The core dynamic-systems metaphors (wave, top, basin, phase) cohere well and do genuine explanatory work—they aren't ornament but conceptual infrastructure. The main opportunities are:

1.  Strengthen Part III's thematic unity with basin callbacks
2.  Extend the zipper metaphor into the conclusion
3.  Retire "boxes" in favor of "basins" for gradient membership
4.  Flag the irony when using Plato's "joints"

The metaphor architecture is a genuine asset. A few minor adjustments would make it stronger still.

**Audit complete.** The book deploys approximately 60+ distinct metaphors across five major families (dynamic-systems, biological, spatial/topological, administrative, political/institutional). The core dynamic-systems cluster—standing wave, spinning top, basin, phase transition—is coherent and load-bearing. Main opportunities: extend the zipper into Part IV, unify Part III with basin callbacks, and phase out "boxes" in favor of gradience-compatible framing.
