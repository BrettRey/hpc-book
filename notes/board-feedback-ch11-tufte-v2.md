# Chapter 11 Feedback: Visualization of Lexical Category Architecture
## Edward Tufte (Data Visualization)

Your core insight is fiercely visual: **same surface distribution, different causal routes**. The challenge is that your readers are trained to see distributions as meaningful. You need figures that make the diversity of mechanism *obvious* — so obvious they can't unsee it.

### 1. Braided vs. Unified: The Saturation Routes Figure

**The problem:** "Determiner resistance" sounds like a unified property. It isn't. Deixis, anaphor, and interrogatives each achieve referential saturation differently.

**Proposal:** A **three-panel convergence diagram** showing:

- **Left panel (Deixis):** Contextual saturation → no determiner needed → *today, tomorrow*
- **Middle panel (Anaphor):** Bound variable → no determiner needed → relative *who*
- **Right panel (Interrogative):** Alternatives-based domain → no determiner needed → *who?*

**The key visual trick:** Use identical **downstream outputs** (blank determiner slot, grammatical resistance to modification) but divergent **upstream causal paths**. The three paths converge into a single distributional pattern — but that convergence is the *interesting fact*, not the end of the story.

**Annotation:** Label the three routes with their saturation mechanism in parentheses. Make it clear: "Same effect, different cause."

This fights the reader's natural tendency to assume that "resistance to determiners" is a *single property* rather than a *functional consequence* of three distinct saturation strategies.

### 2. Surface Convergence from Diverse Mechanisms: The Property-Cluster Table Refined

Your table (Deixis / Anaphor / Interrogative vs. three properties) is good but underutilizes visual space. 

**Revision:** 

- Rows = property types (Semantic, Distributional, Morphological)
- Columns = the three categories (Deixis, Anaphor, Interrogative)
- **Color-code by mechanism type**, not by category:
  - Contextual mechanisms = one color
  - Binding mechanisms = another
  - Alternative-space mechanisms = a third

This lets readers see: *the same cell* (determiner resistance) across all three columns shares different colors. That visual dissonance is your argument made visible.

**Add a marginal annotation:** "Same property; braided mechanisms."

### 3. Fat Category Structure: Adverb as Incoherence

**The visualization stakes:** Adverbs are the *garbage collector* of English grammar — manner, degree, time, locative, modal particles, all crammed together. Their distribution *looks* unified (periphery, adjoin VP/IP), but the mechanisms are wildly heterogeneous.

**Proposal — a two-panel asymmetry:**

**Left panel (Noun/Verb as tight HPC):**
- Central property cluster: phonological, morphological, distributional, semantic
- All mechanisms point inward toward core

**Right panel (Adverb as loose aggregate):**
- Properties scattered across feature space; no central tendency
- Multiple disjoint clouds (manner ≠ degree ≠ modal); each cloud has different causal support
- Label each cloud with its primary maintenance mechanism

**The annotation:** For nouns: "Mechanisms reinforce." For adverbs: "Mechanisms scatter." 

This visually demonstrates why adverbs fail the HPC test: the properties don't *cluster* — they *distribute* as a union of separate subcategories.

### Critical Principle

All three figures should make a single observation **unavoidable**:
> Properties that look bundled from the surface may be braided from underneath.

Your readers will be tempted to treat distribution as *fundamental*. Your figures should break that temptation by making the causal heterogeneity **as visible as the surface unity**.

The reader shouldn't need the prose explanation. The figure should do the intellectual work.
