## Key Concepts

### 1. The Term "Mass-Word" (p. 198)

Jespersen coins the term **"mass-word"** — predating modern "mass noun":

> "There are a great many words which do not call up the idea of some definite thing with a certain shape or precise limits. I call these 'mass-words'; they may be either material, in which case they denote some substance in itself independent of form, such as *silver, quicksilver, water, butter, gas, air*, etc., or else immaterial, such as *leisure, music, traffic, success, tact, commonsense*."

**Use for:** §9.1 — historical grounding for the count/mass distinction.

---

### 2. The Count/Mass Diagnostic (p. 198)

> "While countables are 'quantified' by means of such words as *one, two, many, few*, mass-words are quantified by means of such words as *much, little, less*."

**Use for:** §9.1 — the diagnostic tests are old; the phenomenon has been recognized for a century.

---

### 3. The 1911 Copenhagen Lecture (p. 188, footnote)

> "The substance of this chapter was read as a paper before the Copenhagen Academy of Sciences on November [?], 1911, but never printed."

**Use for:** §9.1 — Jespersen was thinking about these issues *14 years* before publication. The puzzle runs deep.

---

### 4. Flexibility at the Boundary (pp. 199–200)

Jespersen recognizes dual-use / flexible nouns:

> "Some things adapt themselves naturally to different points of view, as seen, for instance, in *fruit, hair* (*much fruit, many fruits*: 'shee hath more hair then wit, and more faults then haires,' Shakespeare)."

**Table of examples (p. 199):**

| Mass-word use | Countable use |
|---------------|---------------|
| a little more cheese | two big cheeses |
| it is hard as iron | a hot iron (flat-iron) |
| cork is lighter than water | three corks for these bottles |
| some earth stuck to his shoes | the earth is round |
| a parcel in brown paper | state papers |
| little talent | few talents |
| much experience | many experiences |

**Use for:** §9.3 or §9.5 — evidence that "grinding" and "packaging" aren't modern discoveries.

---

### 5. Cross-Linguistic Variation (p. 199)

> "It is curious that while Southern English and Standard Danish looks upon *porridge* and *grød* as singulars, the same words are in Scotland and Jutland treated as plurals."

**Use for:** §9.6 or cross-linguistic section — the category boundary is *maintained*, not *fixed*. Different dialects maintain it differently.

---

### 6. Mass → Count Shift via Instantiation (p. 200)

> "Immaterial mass-words undergo a similar change of signification when they come to stand for a single act or instance of the quality, as when we talk of *a stupidity* = a stupid act, *many follies or kindnesses*, etc."

**Use for:** §9.5 — the "packaging" mechanism has been documented for a century.

---

### 7. Collectives vs. Mass-Words: A Strict Distinction (p. 195)

> "I think this term [collective] should not be used in the loose way often found in grammatical works, but only in the strict sense of words which denote a unit made up of several things or beings which may be counted separately; a collective, then, is logically from one point of view 'one' and from another point of view 'more than one' ... the notion of number being logically inapplicable to mass-words, while it is doubly applicable to collectives."

**Use for:** §9.2 — distinguishes aggregate semantics (mass) from group semantics (collective). *Cattle* and *police* are collectives, not mass-words — they're counted as plural aggregates, not as unbounded stuff.

---

### 8. Paired Objects and Number (pp. 189–190)

Cross-linguistic handling of *trousers, spectacles, scissors*:
- English uses plural forms for unit-inherent pairs
- French uses *une paire de*
- German uses singular (*eine brille*)

**Hungarian treats paired body parts as wholes:**

> "*fél szemmel* 'with one eye' = literally 'with half eye(s)'"

**Use for:** Possible footnote or brief mention — individuation is language-specific, not read off physics.

---

### 9. "Common Number" Desideratum (p. 198)

> "The want of a common number form (i.e. a form that disregards the distinction between singular and plural) is sometimes felt, but usually the only way to satisfy it is through such clumsy devices as 'a star or two,' 'one or more stars.'"

**Use for:** Possible aside — speakers sometimes *want* the distinction to disappear but the grammar won't let them.

---

### 10. Nomenclature Note (p. 200)

> "Through the term 'mass-word' and through the restriction of the term 'collective' to a well-defined class of words, so that the two terms are consistently opposed to one another ... I hope to have contributed something towards clarifying a difficult subject."

**Use for:** Acknowledge Jespersen's terminological contribution in a footnote.

## Possible Quotations for Chapter 9

### For opening of §9.1 (replacing or complementing the current Jespersen mention, line 33):

> "There are a great many words which do not call up the idea of some definite thing with a certain shape or precise limits. I call these 'mass-words'." — Jespersen 1924:198

### For §9.1 or footnote (on the long gestation):

> "The substance of this chapter was read as a paper before the Copenhagen Academy of Sciences on November [?], 1911, but never printed." — Jespersen 1924:188n

### For §9.5 (flexibility):

> "Some things adapt themselves naturally to different points of view, as seen, for instance, in *fruit, hair* (*much fruit, many fruits*)." — Jespersen 1924:199

## Connection to Current Draft

The current chapter (lines 31–34) already mentions Jespersen 1924 and the 1911 lecture:

> "Since Otto Jespersen first formalized the distinction in 1924, grammarians have operationalized this intuition with a battery of tests. But the insight goes back further. In an unpublished 1911 lecture to the Copenhagen Academy of Sciences, Jespersen had already noted the core puzzle."

This could be **strengthened** by:
1. Adding the actual "mass-word" definition as a quotation
2. Using the cheese/iron/cork table as evidence for flexibility
3. Mentioning the porridge/grød dialectal variation as early evidence that the boundary is *maintained*, not *discovered*

---

## Items NOT in Chapter 9 Yet (Candidates for Integration)

1. **The Shakespeare quotation** — vivid, from the horse's mouth so to speak ("shee hath more hair then wit, and more faults then haires")
2. **The cheese/iron/cork table** — structured evidence for flexible nouns
3. **Porridge/grød** — dialectal variation
4. **Hungarian paired body parts** — strong cross-linguistic evidence
5. **The "common number" observation** — speakers sometimes wish the distinction away
