Floyd, S., Jouravlev, O., Poliak, M., Mineroff, Z., Gibson, E., & Fedorenko, E. (2025). Three distinct components of pragmatic language use: Social conventions, intonation, and world knowledge–based causal reasoning. *PNAS*, 122(50), e2424400122. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2424400122

## Summary

Factor analysis of 776 participants on 20+ pragmatic tasks reveals that "pragmatic inference" fractionates into **three dissociable cognitive components**:

1. **Social conventions** — indirect requests, conversational implicatures, irony (+ possibly metaphor, humor, polite deceits)
2. **Intonation** — contrastive and emotional prosody
3. **Causal reasoning** — world knowledge-based inference

Scalar implicatures loaded on their *own* factor, separate even from "Social conventions."

## HPC Diagnostic Assessment

### "Pragmatics" = Fat Cluster

The umbrella term "pragmatic inference" fails HPC diagnostics:
- Components do NOT covary strongly across individuals
- Components do NOT share neural substrates (by implication)
- Components may have distinct developmental trajectories
- **Low projective force**: knowing something is "pragmatic" doesn't predict which component it loads on

### The Three Components as Better HPC Candidates

| Component | Internal Coherence | Maintenance Mechanisms? | Projective Force |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Social conventions** | High — tasks cluster tightly | Theory of Mind (putative) | Strong — predicts processing, neural basis |
| **Intonation** | High — even after controlling for low-level auditory ability | Acoustic-prosodic processing | Strong — predicts modality dependence |
| **Causal reasoning** | Moderate — some internal fractionation | World knowledge systems | Weaker — may fractionate further |

### Key Quotes

> "we found that some phenomena consistently group together, but that pragmatic language use encompasses **at least three distinct components**" (p. 6)

> "our results call for **more precision in using such terms** [as 'pragmatic abilities'] given that not all nonliteral comprehension phenomena cluster onto a single factor" (p. 8)

> "phenomena loading on the same factor should emerge together during development, and phenomena that load on different factors may show **distinct trajectories**" (p. 9) — *This is HPC's prediction about homeostasis!*

## Methodological Takeaway

**Individual-differences factor analysis as HPC diagnostic tool:**
- If tasks cluster across individuals → shared maintenance mechanisms → likely HPC kind
- If tasks fractionate → nominal grouping → "fat cluster" or constructed class

This parallels the diagnostic structure in Chapter 8: ask whether variance in one feature predicts variance in others.

## Integration Points

### Chapter 8 (Failure Modes)
- "Pragmatics" as textbook fat cluster
- The three components pass projectibility test better than umbrella term
- Scalar implicatures may require even finer grain

### Chapter 13 (Grammaticality)
- Where does syntax end and pragmatics begin?
- "Social conventions" component may interact with morphosyntax differently than "Intonation" or "Causal reasoning"

### Methodological Appendix
- Factor analysis as empirical test for HPC status
- Contrast with traditional definitional approaches
