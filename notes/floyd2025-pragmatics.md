## Citation

Floyd, S., Jouravlev, O., Poliak, M., et al. (2025). Three distinct components of pragmatic language use: Social conventions, intonation, and world knowledge–based causal reasoning. *PNAS*, 122(50), e2424400122. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2424400122

## Key Finding

Factor analysis of 776 participants on 20 pragmatic tasks reveals **three dissociable components**:

1. **Social conventions** — indirect requests, conversational implicatures, irony
2. **Intonation interpretation** — contrastive and emotional prosody
3. **Causal reasoning** — world knowledge-based inference

## HPC Diagnostic Questions

| Question | Preliminary Assessment |
|----------|------------------------|
| Do components cluster *together* or merely share a label? | Discovered via *dissociation* — suggests label problem |
| Are there maintenance mechanisms between components? | Unknown — need full text |
| Does "pragmatics" have projective force? | Weak — knowing something is "pragmatic" doesn't predict which component |
| Are the three components better HPC candidates? | Possibly — each has neural, developmental, genetic coherence |

## Potential Book Integration

### Chapter 8 (Failure Modes)
- Example of **fat clustering** — umbrella term that obscures real joints
- Demonstrates grain-of-analysis problem

### Part III (Case Study)
- Could parallel countability chapter: "Is pragmatics a category?"
- Tests HPC diagnostic: fractionation suggests constructed class

### Chapter 13 (Grammaticality)
- Relevant if discussing where syntax ends and pragmatics begins
- Components might differentially interact with morphosyntax

## To Do

- [ ] Request full text from author (Fedorenko: evelina9@mit.edu) or library
- [ ] Check if components interact (mutual reinforcement = homeostasis)
- [ ] Look for deficit studies: does impairment in one predict impairment in others?
- [ ] Consider for Chapter 8 revision or Part III chapter

---

## Notes

Fedorenko's lab focuses on dissociating language from domain-general cognition — framing HPC as "diagnostic for natural kinds" might resonate with her research program.
