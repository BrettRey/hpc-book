## Core Argument

Sullivan argues that **actual scientific practice in cognitive neuroscience is not conducive to discovering natural kinds** (specifically MPC/HPC kinds). The problem is lack of coordination across three levels:

1. **Conceptual practices** — Investigators use constructs (e.g., "spatial memory," "working memory") inconsistently; meanings drift across labs
2. **Experimental practices** — Paradigms differ in subtle ways even when investigators claim to study "the same" phenomenon
3. **Integrative practices** — Review papers and meta-analyses abstract away from precisely the details that would reveal whether labs are tracking the same kind

Her conclusion: "healthy anti-realism about the kinds of cognitive capacities currently on offer" (p. 55).

## Key Concepts

### MPC (Mechanistic Property Clusters)
Cites Craver's formulation: "groups of properties that co-occur and whose 'co-occurrence [...] from individual to individual is explained by causal mechanisms that regularly ensure these properties are instantiated together'" (p. 48).

This is the neuroscience-specific version of Boyd's HPC.

### Construct Validity
Borrowed from psychology. An experimental paradigm has construct validity when "the effect under study in laboratory" matches "the cognitive phenomena designated by the construct" (p. 51).

Sullivan's point: Many neuroscientists prioritize **reliability** (reproducibility) over **validity** (tracking the right phenomenon).

### Construct Explication Process
A series of questions:
1. Which instances should be grouped under the construct?
2. Which investigative strategies yield instances of the construct?
3. Should strategies be modified?
4. Should the construct itself be revised?

## Why Linguistics Might Be Different (Your Counter-Argument)

Sullivan's skepticism rests on:
- Phenomena are produced *in the lab* via paradigms, not observed in the wild
- Multi-level mechanisms (molecular, cellular, systems) require coordination across levels
- No shared constructs across labs

**For grammatical categories:**
- The phenomena exist *in natural language use* — corpora, introspection, cross-linguistic data
- Mechanisms are cognitive/linguistic, not distributed across cellular levels
- Constructs (noun, verb, determinative) have long traditions with shared (if contested) definitions
- The "construct explication" process *does* happen in grammar — e.g., CGEL refining "determiner" to "determinative"

So your position can acknowledge Sullivan's skepticism about neuroscience while arguing linguistics has better coordination and more tractable phenomena.

## Where to Cite

### Chapter 4 (HPC Introduction)
- Cite MPC formulation (p. 48) as evidence HPC is used beyond biology
- Note Sullivan's skepticism as a challenge to address
- Brief contrast: linguistics may avoid the coordination problems she identifies

### Chapter 8 (Failure Modes)
- Her lumping/splitting discussion fits "fat cluster" and "thin cluster" diagnostics
- Her point that same surface phenomenon may reflect different mechanisms parallels your "class vs. category" distinction

### Not Needed
- Chapter 2 (too meta-theoretical)
- Chapter 9-12 (too far from her concerns)

## Quotable Passages

1. **MPC definition:** "groups of properties that co-occur and whose co-occurrence [...] is explained by causal mechanisms that regularly ensure these properties are instantiated together" (p. 48)

2. **Construct validity problem:** "different investigators who claim to be investigating the same phenomenon are actually investigating different phenomena produced by different mechanisms" (p. 54)

3. **Anti-realism conclusion:** "healthy anti-realism about the kinds of cognitive capacities and their mechanisms currently on offer in the neurosciences of cognition" (p. 55)

## Suggested Citation

> Sullivan (2016) argues that neuroscience lacks the coordination in conceptual and experimental practices required to discover mechanistic property clusters (Craver's variant of HPC kinds). Her skepticism applies less directly to grammatical categories, where constructs are anchored in observable language use and refined through cross-linguistic comparison rather than lab paradigms.
