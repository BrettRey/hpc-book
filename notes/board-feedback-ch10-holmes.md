## Summary
Readers will remember the split if they can see it. Give them a small, friendly map that shows how form and function line up most of the time, and where they slip.

## Figure concept: the 2x2 map
A simple 2x2 grid with axes labeled Form Cluster (low -> high) and Definiteness Cluster (low -> high). Put short examples in each quadrant:
- High/High: the cat we discussed
- High form / low definiteness: the hospital (weak definite)
- Low form / high definiteness: Kim, London
- Low/Low: dogs bark (generic bare plural)
This gives the reader an instant "aha" without extra jargon.

## Secondary concept: two gears with slack
Two gears labeled Form and Definiteness, mostly meshed but with a small gap. A small callout shows weak definites in the slack. Keep it flat and schematic.

## Keep the diagnostics table, but make it readable
Consider a very light row tint or spacing to show groupings (prototypical, mixed, non-members). The table itself is the evidence; the map is the memory aid.
