This Ambridge paper is a perfect illustration of the internalist confusion I have spent my career combating, yet it offers a mechanical insight that serves your "Maintenance View" beautifully. You must address this in **Chapter 4**, specifically where you discuss the reality of kinds without essences. Ambridge assumes that because a category (like a Noun) isn't explicitly represented as a static token in the individual brain—like a file in a cabinet—it is therefore merely "emergent" and, by implication, less real. This is a category error. A biological species is not "represented" in the genes of a single organism; the *mechanism* for reproducing the species is there, but the species itself exists as an extended lineage in the world. Ambridge’s "radical exemplar model" is simply a description of the proximal mechanism by which the lineage reproduces itself.

The honeycomb analogy he relies on is actually fatal to his anti-realist conclusion, provided you read it through a proper-function lens. He argues that the hexagonal structure isn't in the bee's brain, so the hexagon isn't "real" in the cognitive architecture. Precisely! The hexagon is a feature of the *hive*, a public structure selected for its efficiency in storing honey. It is a stable, reproducible pattern maintained by the interacting behaviors of the bees. Similarly, the "Noun" category is a public feature of the language lineage—a stable trough in the landscape of communicative possibilities—maintained by the "exemplar dynamics" (analogizing) of speakers. The structure is real because it is selected for; it persists because it works.

Therefore, engage Ambridge in **Chapter 4, Section 2 ("From species to categories")**. Use him to buttress the argument that mechanisms (his exemplar dynamics) need not look like the things they maintain (the resulting grammatical categories). He provides the *how* (analogy across tokens), while you provide the *what* (an HPC kind). His rejection of "stored abstractions" is effectively a rejection of "essences" in the head. By positioning his exemplar model as the *homeostatic mechanism* that keeps the "Noun" cluster stable, you co-opt his argument: he hasn't shown that categories aren't real; he has simply shown that they are maintained dynamically rather than statically. This validates your "Dynamic Discreteness" thesis before you even get to Chapter 5.
