### Feedback on Chapter 13: The Stack
**From:** Ian Hacking

I find your ambition to demonstrate "scale invariance" across the linguistic stack intriguing, but I caution you against smoothing over the profound ontological shift that occurs as you move up that stack. You are treating phonemes and constructions as if they are the same *sort* of thing, maintained by the same *sort* of logic, merely differing in their "coupling." I suspect the difference is far more radical. You are moving from what I call **indifferent kinds** to **interactive kinds**—and your "stabilizers" column in §13.5 betrays this shift even if your text does not yet fully acknowledge it.

At the bottom of your stack (§13.2), phonemes are stabilized by "quantal regions" and "dispersion pressure." These are biophysical constraints; the vocal tract and the auditory system are indifferent to how we classify them. A vowel does not change its form because a linguist labels it /i/. But as you ascend to constructions (§13.4), the stabilizers become "entrenchment" and "normative enforcement." Here, you enter the realm of **looping effects**. A construction like *let alone* or the "academic passive" exists and stabilizes precisely because speakers (and teachers) classify, recognize, and enforce it. The category acts back upon the categorized. Your "re-coupling" is not just a structural feature; it is the entry of human agency and social looping into the mechanism of stability.

Regarding your negative case in §13.6 ("Academic Passive"): do not be so quick to dismiss it simply because it fails your homeostasis test. This is a perfect example of "making up people"—or in this case, "making up registers." You argue it lacks a single stabilizer regime. I argue that its instability is characteristic of purely institutional kinds. It exists *only* because style guides and editors enforce it. It is an artifact of classification, whereas your HPC kinds (like the *caused-motion construction*) are likely organic interactive kinds that have achieved a stability independent of explicit policing. Use this distinction: the difference between a category that requires constant bureaucratic maintenance (the register) and one that maintains itself through the looping effect of usage (the construction).

Finally, I worry your "Coupling Gradient" metaphor implies a continuum where there is a rupture. The "hard-coupling" of the phoneme is a matter of physics and perception; the "re-coupling" of the construction is a matter of convention and inference. To say they are both "coupled" is true, but it is like saying a stone and a contract are both "solid." One is held together by molecular bonds, the other by law. If the HPC framework is to hold, it must explain how *natural* property clusters (sounds) evolve into *social* property clusters (grammar) without the whole edifice collapsing into mere convention. Focus §13.3 (Morphemes) on this precise moment of alchemy.
