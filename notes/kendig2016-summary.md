## Chapter Assessments (by Brett, 2025-12-16)

### Ch 1 — Nickel, "Explanatory Strategies in Linguistic Practice"
**Relevance: 0.25–0.35 (peripheral)**

Argues disciplines delimit subject matter via *explanatory strategies*, not extensions. Traces Saussure → Bloomfield → Chomsky using Putnam's anchor/generator model.

**Offers:**
- Boyd HPC cited (fn. 13) as similar deference model
- Argument that phenomena cluster by *explanatory coherence* is philosophically sympathetic to HPC
- Point about identical surface data reflecting different causes parallels concern with syntactic vs. pragmatic constraints

**Doesn't address:**
- Whether grammatical categories are HPC kinds
- Internal structure of linguistic categories as property clusters
- Direct HPC engagement

**Bottom line:** About *what makes something linguistics' subject matter* (meta-disciplinary), not *what kind of thing grammatical categories are*. Worth knowing exists; don't prioritize unless writing on disciplinary boundaries.

### Ch 3 — Sullivan, "Neuroscientific Kinds"
**Relevance: 0.40–0.50 (moderately relevant, worth reading)**

Directly engages Craver's MPC (Mechanistic Property Cluster) — neuroscience variant of HPC. Argues practice isn't coordinated enough to discover such kinds.

**What's useful:**
1. **MPC as HPC variant:** Clean formulation of "groups of properties whose co-occurrence is explained by causal mechanisms" (p. 48)
2. **Lumping/splitting problem:** Scientists may wrongly lump different phenomena or split ones that belong together — maps to grammatical categories
3. **Construct validity:** Do linguists across frameworks refer to same categories?
4. **Anti-realism worry:** Her "healthy anti-realism about cognitive kinds" is position to address — your answer: grammar's mechanisms more tractable than neural ones

**Limitations:**
- No direct linguistic engagement
- Her skepticism may be stronger than warranted for grammar
- Neural/cellular mechanisms ≠ grammatical property clusters

**Bottom line:** Worth a paragraph or two situating HPC-for-grammar within broader philosophy of science, distinguishing optimistic take from Sullivan's skepticism.

### Ch 10 — Spencer, "Genuine Kinds and Scientific Reality"
**Relevance: 0.20–0.30 (limited)**

Meta-theoretic refinement arguing "genuine kinds" are valid kinds in well-ordered SRPs. Targets overly permissive theories (Boyd) that can't exclude baramin.

**Marginally useful:**
1. **Critique of Boyd's permissiveness:** HPC can't rule out baramin — note if anticipating "too liberal" objections. Counter: linguistic categories not discipline-relative in problematic way
2. **Kinds without inductive power:** Superheavy elements (6 atoms, milliseconds) — analogous defense of thin grammatical categories
3. **Relativized a priori vs. empirical kinds:** Might map to framework-constitutive vs. discovered subcategories

**Why not more relevant:**
- No linguistic engagement
- "Well-ordered SRP" criteria pitched at science vs. pseudo-science, not HPC quality
- Critique of Boyd doesn't land for grammar (not worried about pseudo-science)

**Bottom line:** Philosophy of science housekeeping. Skim Boyd critique (§4) and move on.

## Key Takeaways for HPC Book

1. **Nickel supports the view that grammatical categories are defined by explanatory practice** — not essences, not extensions alone
2. **Sullivan's skepticism about neuroscientific kinds** could be a useful foil — linguistics may be better positioned than neuroscience for HPC discovery
3. **Spencer's critique of natural kind theories** — ensure HPC account doesn't fall into same traps (failing to predict paradigm cases)
