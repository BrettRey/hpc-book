This is a fantastic draft. You had me at LEGO. That opening is exactly the kind of "science of the mundane" hook that pulls a general reader into a complex topic. You take something everyone has fought with—parents stepping on bricks, kids adding an 's'—and use it to open up a hidden world of cognitive machinery. The "data" and "pea" stories serve the same function; they ground the high theory in the messy reality of how we actually speak.

That said, you have a tendency to slip into "lab report mode," particularly in Section 12. Terms like "ablation by perturbation," "disconfirmation condition," and "reallocation" are precise, but they act like speed bumps for a lay reader. I felt the prose stiffen there. You are writing a book about language, but in that section, you sound like you’re writing a grant proposal for a physics experiment. You can keep the rigor without the rigidity. Instead of "Perturbation 1: The collective basin," try a header like "What happens when you remove the default?" Frame the cross-linguistic evidence as a travelogue of "what-ifs" rather than a clinical trial.

Regarding accessibility, the definitions in Section 2 ("accessibility of atoms to quantificational operations," "homogeneity resistance") are heavy lifting. You define them, which is good, but you pile them up quickly. I would slow down the "individuation" section. The comparison to macrophages and echolocation is brilliant—it’s right up my alley—but make sure the bridge back to linguistics is sturdy. Explicitly state that the brain is a miser that reuses the same "edge-detection" software for vision, immunity, and grammar. Don't let the reader think it's just a poetic metaphor; convince them it's biological recycling.

For analogies, the "lock and key" with varying tolerances is effective, but consider a biological parallel to the "coupling" in Section 4. Think about **co-evolution or symbiosis**. The clownfish and the anemone aren't just "coupled"; they reinforce each other. The clownfish (the word) gets protection (stability) from the anemone (the grammar), and in return, the clownfish feeds the anemone. If you separate them, they both struggle. *Data* is currently a clownfish searching for a new host because its old anemone (*datum*) died. This might feel more dynamic than "locks," which imply a static mechanical fit, whereas your whole argument is about dynamic, homeostatic maintenance.
