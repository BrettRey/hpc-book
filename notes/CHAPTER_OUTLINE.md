# Chapter Outline: Language Without Essences: The Metaphysics of Linguistic Categories

## Part I: The Problem (3 chapters)

### Ch 1: Words That Won't Hold Still
*The question linguists think they've answered but haven't*

**Key points:**
- The unexamined assumption: categories exist with determinate boundaries
- What linguists ask vs. what those questions presuppose
- Setting up the stakes: linguistics has a problem it doesn't know it has
- The "Impasse": Essentialism fails on data; Prototype Theory fails on explanation.
- Teaser examples outside morphosyntax: phoneme contrasts, register/style, pragmatic labels
- *Note: HPC introduction moved to Part II.*

### Ch 2: Essentialism and its discontents
*Why the default view fails—furniture, weak definites, boundary cases*

**Key points:**
- The essentialist default: necessary and sufficient conditions
- Systematic failures: *furniture*, *the*, reciprocals
- Essentialist pressure points beyond grammar (phonemes, register, pragmatic taxonomies)
- Boundary cases aren't noise—they're evidence
- The "blocked question": definition-seeking vs. mechanism-seeking
- *Note: "The temptation" section moved/integrated into Chapter 3.*

### Ch 3: What we haven't been asking
*The pivot: The nominalist temptation and why it fails*

**Key points:**
- **The nominalist temptation:** Haspelmath's "comparative concepts" argument. If definitions fail, maybe categories are just convenient fictions?
- **The cost:** If categories are just yardsticks, cross-linguistic stability is unexplained.
- **The nominalist overcorrection:** Conflating "no essence" with "no determinacy."
- **The need for discipline:** If some categories are natural kinds and some aren't, we need criteria.
- **The questions neither tradition has posed:** What maintains stability without essence?
- Preview the book's bigger promise: a sieve for linguistic categories, not just grammatical ones

## Part II: The Fix

### Ch 4: Homeostatic Property Clusters
*The third option: neither essence nor fiction*

**Key points:**
- The species problem in biology: Boyd's HPC solution
- What HPC kinds are: property clusters + mechanisms
- The standing-wave metaphor: dynamic stability
- Sciences that made the shift (biology, chemistry)
- From biology to linguistics: the parallel (grammar, phonology, register)
- Mechanisms preview (acquisition, entrenchment, alignment, transmission) — *conceptual intro; full treatment in Ch 7*
- What counts as explanation: mechanism-talk vs. circular classification
- HPC recovers determinacy: causal grounding, localized indeterminacy
- Neo-Aristotelian coda: Ch 2 exonerated Aristotle; Ch 4 recovers him

### Ch 5: Discrete from continuous
*The discreteness problem and its hyperreal solution*

**Key points:**
- The discreteness problem: continuous substrates → discrete categories
- Phase transitions as model: scale-dependent tolerance
- The hyperreal formalization: infinitesimals, sharp boundaries
- From heaps to categories: multi-dimensional feature spaces
- Mechanisms and basins: geometry + maintenance — *applied to discreteness; deep-dive in Ch 7*
- Worked non-grammar example: phoneme boundaries from continuous cues
- Gradient judgments, discrete categories
- Dual membership explained

### Ch 6: Projectibility and the good bet
*The epistemic payoff*

**Key points:**
- **The definitional bet:** Definitions are predictions about clustering, not constitutive truths.
- **The mechanistic alternative:** Projectibility tracks mechanism, not definition (Polish aspect & Goodman's grue).
- **Labels aren't mechanisms:** "Aspect" as a legacy label vs. the actual causal maintenance.
- **Generalising the lesson:** Definitional failure as diagnostic; mechanism-based success.
- **The epistemic payoff:** Degrees of projectibility; why we are entitled to induce.
- Cross-domain stress test: what counts as projectibility in phonology and register

### Ch 7: The Stabilisers (renamed from Homeostasis)
*The mechanistic story — biological explanatory style*

**Key points:**
- The cluster: what properties co-occur? (macrophage → nouns)
- Stabilisers at multiple scales (cognitive, acquisition, discourse, social, transmission)
- Variation as activation states: same kind, different state under different signals
- One case in depth: **TBD — evidentials (Japanese/Turkish) or cross-linguistic quotatives**
- Side-by-side sketches: contrast maintenance (phonology) and social enforcement (register)
- Robustness tests: learning transfer, intervention stability, cross-context generalisation
- Degrees of projectibility: mechanism support → stability gradient
- Commitments: process ontology, reciprocal realism, variation as signal, cross-level coherence
- *Scope: Full treatment of mechanisms previewed in Ch 4; applied to basins in Ch 5*
- *Integrated citations: MacKenzie 2019, Weiner & Labov 1983*

### Ch 8: Failure modes—thin, fat, negative
*How to know when you don't have a kind*

**Key points:**
- **The Inflation Problem:** Why we see HPCs everywhere (payoff vs property confusion)
- **O'Connor's Diagnostic:** Payoff similarity ≠ property similarity (sim-max games)
- **Thin clustering:** Insufficient homeostasis (whose-stranding, nonce coinages)
- **Fat clustering:** Multiple kinds lumped together (adverb wastebasket)
- **Negative diagnosis:** Taxonomic convenience, not natural kind (non-finite)
- **The Grain Question:** Madagascar analogy—individual constructions are HPCs, "grammar" is an ecosystem
- Non-grammar worked failure: a familiar pragmatic or register label that looks useful but doesn't behave like a kind
- **Two-Diagnostic Test:** Projectibility (epistemic) + Homeostasis (ontological)
- **Principled criteria for kind-hood:** Learning transfer, intervention stability, cross-context generalisation

## Part III: Categories Reconsidered

### Ch 9: Countability
*A grammatical category done right*

**Key points:**
- Property cluster for countability
- Mechanisms stabilizing count/mass distinction
- Peripheral cases as tolerated variation

### Ch 10: Definiteness and deitality
*Form-meaning misalignment explained*

**Key points:**
- Weak definites, generic definites, other "exceptions"
- Form and function as separate HPC kinds
- Why misalignment is stable

### Ch 11: Word classes
*The adjective-adverb asymmetry as architectural equilibrium*

**Key points:**
- Cross-linguistic stability of nouns/verbs
- Adjective-adverb variation
- Architectural equilibrium: mechanisms at different scales

### Ch 12: The stack
*From phonemes to constructions—same logic, different stabilizers*

**Key points:**
- Phonemes as a positive case: acoustic-articulatory clustering + contrast maintenance
- Register/style as a negative or grain-sensitive case: real patterns, messy ontology
- Morphemes: form-meaning pairing
- Constructions: multi-level property clusters
- Scale-invariant framework

## Part IV: Implications

### Ch 13: Grammaticality itself
*The deepest category, also an HPC*

**Key points:**
- Grammaticality judgments: gradient, context-sensitive, stable
- The category "grammatical" as HPC kind
- Foundations for foundations
- **Form-meaning pairing as core mechanism**: If grammatical HPCs typically decompose into semantic + morphosyntactic clusters at finer grain (as countability does), this echoes CxG's claim that constructions are form-meaning pairings. Grammaticality itself may be maintained by this dual structure — not a contingent pattern but a principled necessity. Connect HPC architecture to Construction Grammar here.

### Ch 14: What changes
*Methodology, theory, typology—concrete consequences*

**Key points:**
- Methodological shifts: gradient judgments, corpus distributions, experimental probes
- Theoretical dissolution: gradience vs. discreteness debate
- Typological rigor: assessing cross-linguistic categories empirically
- What questions linguists should now ask

---

## Notes

- Each chapter should include worked examples
- Part III chapters are case studies demonstrating the framework
- Part IV synthesizes implications for practice
- Target: ~15-20 pages per chapter for substantive chapters

**Total: 14 chapters across 4 parts** (Chapter 4 restored as HPC introduction, December 2025)
