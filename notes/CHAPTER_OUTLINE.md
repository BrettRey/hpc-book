# Chapter Outline: Language Without Essences

## Part I: The Problem (3 chapters)

### Ch 1: Words That Won't Hold Still
*The question linguists think they've answered but haven't*

**Key points:**
- The unexamined assumption: categories exist with determinate boundaries
- What linguists ask vs. what those questions presuppose
- Setting up the stakes: linguistics has a problem it doesn't know it has
- The "Impasse": Essentialism fails on data; Prototype Theory fails on explanation.
- *Note: HPC introduction moved to Part II.*

### Ch 2: Essentialism and its discontents
*Why the default view fails—furniture, weak definites, boundary cases*

**Key points:**
- The essentialist default: necessary and sufficient conditions
- Systematic failures: *furniture*, *the*, reciprocals
- Boundary cases aren't noise—they're evidence
- The "blocked question": definition-seeking vs. mechanism-seeking
- *Note: "The temptation" section moved/integrated into Chapter 3.*

### Ch 3: What we haven't been asking
*The pivot: The nominalist temptation and why it fails*

**Key points:**
- **The nominalist temptation:** Haspelmath's "comparative concepts" argument. If definitions fail, maybe categories are just convenient fictions?
- **The cost:** If categories are just yardsticks, cross-linguistic stability is unexplained.
- **The nominalist overcorrection:** Conflating "no essence" with "no determinacy."
- **The need for discipline:** If some categories are natural kinds and some aren't, we need criteria.
- **The questions neither tradition has posed:** What maintains stability without essence?

## Part II: The Fix

### Ch 5: Kinds without essences
*HPC introduced, but motivated by the problems in Part I*

**Key points:**
- The species problem in biology
- HPC solution: property clusters + mechanisms
- Extension to grammar (not mere analogy)

### Ch 6: Projectibility—why categories support induction
*The epistemic payoff*

**Key points:**
- What makes a category projectible
- How HPC delivers projectibility without essentialism
- Linguistic generalizations as mechanistically grounded

### Ch 7: Homeostasis—why categories hold together
*The mechanistic story*

**Key points:**
- Acquisition, entrenchment, interactive alignment, iterated transmission
- The *the* example: mechanisms in action
- Why clusters stay bundled despite fuzzy boundaries

### Ch 8: Failure modes—thin, fat, negative
*How to know when you don't have a kind*

**Key points:**
- Thin clustering: insufficient homeostasis
- Fat clustering: multiple kinds lumped together
- Negative diagnosis: taxonomic convenience, not natural kind
- Principled criteria for kind-hood

## Part III: Categories Reconsidered

### Ch 9: Countability
*A grammatical category done right*

**Key points:**
- Property cluster for countability
- Mechanisms stabilizing count/mass distinction
- Peripheral cases as tolerated variation

### Ch 10: Definiteness and deitality
*Form-meaning misalignment explained*

**Key points:**
- Weak definites, generic definites, other "exceptions"
- Form and function as separate HPC kinds
- Why misalignment is stable

### Ch 11: Word classes
*The adjective-adverb asymmetry as architectural equilibrium*

**Key points:**
- Cross-linguistic stability of nouns/verbs
- Adjective-adverb variation
- Architectural equilibrium: mechanisms at different scales

### Ch 12: The stack
*From phonemes to constructions—same logic, different stabilizers*

**Key points:**
- Phonemes: acoustic-articulatory clustering
- Morphemes: form-meaning pairing
- Constructions: multi-level property clusters
- Scale-invariant framework

## Part IV: Implications

### Ch 13: Grammaticality itself
*The deepest category, also an HPC*

**Key points:**
- Grammaticality judgments: gradient, context-sensitive, stable
- The category "grammatical" as HPC kind
- Foundations for foundations

### Ch 14: What changes
*Methodology, theory, typology—concrete consequences*

**Key points:**
- Methodological shifts: gradient judgments, corpus distributions, experimental probes
- Theoretical dissolution: gradience vs. discreteness debate
- Typological rigor: assessing cross-linguistic categories empirically
- What questions linguists should now ask

---

## Notes

- Each chapter should include worked examples
- Part III chapters are case studies demonstrating the framework
- Part IV synthesizes implications for practice
- Target: ~15-20 pages per chapter for substantive chapters

**Total: 13 chapters across 4 parts** (Chapter 4 was cut in December 2025)
