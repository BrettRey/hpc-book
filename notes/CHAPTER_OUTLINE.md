# Chapter Outline: Language Without Essences

## Part I: The Problem

### Ch 1: What are grammatical categories?
*The question linguists think they've answered but haven't*

**Key points:**
- The unexamined assumption: categories exist with determinate boundaries
- What linguists ask vs. what those questions presuppose
- Setting up the stakes

### Ch 2: Essentialism and its discontents
*Why the default view fails—furniture, weak definites, boundary cases*

**Key points:**
- The essentialist default: necessary and sufficient conditions
- Systematic failures: *furniture*, *the*, reciprocals
- Boundary cases aren't noise—they're evidence

### Ch 3: The nominalist temptation
*Why "it's all gradient/constructed/statistical" throws out the baby*

**Key points:**
- The retreat to gradience: prototypes, feature bundles, and fuzzy boundaries
- What this captures (phenomena) vs. what it doesn't explain (stability)
- Why similarity space alone can't account for acquisition, projectibility

### Ch 4: The cost of confusion
*Specific research programs held back by unclear foundations*

**Key points:**
- Concrete examples of research stalled by bad metaphysics
- Typology: assumed universals vs. empirical kinds
- Methodology: when boundary cases become principled data

## Part II: The Fix

### Ch 5: Kinds without essences
*HPC introduced, but motivated by the problems in Part I*

**Key points:**
- The species problem in biology
- HPC solution: property clusters + mechanisms
- Extension to grammar (not mere analogy)

### Ch 6: Projectibility—why categories support induction
*The epistemic payoff*

**Key points:**
- What makes a category projectible
- How HPC delivers projectibility without essentialism
- Linguistic generalizations as mechanistically grounded

### Ch 7: Homeostasis—why categories hold together
*The mechanistic story*

**Key points:**
- Acquisition, entrenchment, interactive alignment, iterated transmission
- The *the* example: mechanisms in action
- Why clusters stay bundled despite fuzzy boundaries

### Ch 8: Failure modes—thin, fat, negative
*How to know when you don't have a kind*

**Key points:**
- Thin clustering: insufficient homeostasis
- Fat clustering: multiple kinds lumped together
- Negative diagnosis: taxonomic convenience, not natural kind
- Principled criteria for kind-hood

## Part III: Categories Reconsidered

### Ch 9: Countability
*A grammatical category done right*

**Key points:**
- Property cluster for countability
- Mechanisms stabilizing count/mass distinction
- Peripheral cases as tolerated variation

### Ch 10: Definiteness and deitality
*Form-meaning misalignment explained*

**Key points:**
- Weak definites, generic definites, other "exceptions"
- Form and function as separate HPC kinds
- Why misalignment is stable

### Ch 11: Word classes
*The adjective-adverb asymmetry as architectural equilibrium*

**Key points:**
- Cross-linguistic stability of nouns/verbs
- Adjective-adverb variation
- Architectural equilibrium: mechanisms at different scales

### Ch 12: The stack
*From phonemes to constructions—same logic, different stabilizers*

**Key points:**
- Phonemes: acoustic-articulatory clustering
- Morphemes: form-meaning pairing
- Constructions: multi-level property clusters
- Scale-invariant framework

## Part IV: Implications

### Ch 13: Grammaticality itself
*The deepest category, also an HPC*

**Key points:**
- Grammaticality judgments: gradient, context-sensitive, stable
- The category "grammatical" as HPC kind
- Foundations for foundations

### Ch 14: What changes
*Methodology, theory, typology—concrete consequences*

**Key points:**
- Methodological shifts: gradient judgments, corpus distributions, experimental probes
- Theoretical dissolution: gradience vs. discreteness debate
- Typological rigor: assessing cross-linguistic categories empirically
- What questions linguists should now ask

---

## Notes

- Each chapter should include worked examples
- Part III chapters are case studies demonstrating the framework
- Part IV synthesizes implications for practice
- Target: ~15-20 pages per chapter for substantive chapters

**Total: 14 chapters across 4 parts**
