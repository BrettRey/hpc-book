Excellent. This is a robust and logical plan. The architecture is sound, and the progression from phoneme to construction provides a clear narrative through-line for the chapter. My comments are aimed at sharpening the central metaphor and ensuring the argument lands with maximum impact for a non-specialist reader who has been following along since Chapter 1.

The core idea of a "coupling gradient" is powerful, but the term itself feels a bit technical, perhaps more like an engineering spec-sheet than a description of a living, evolving system. I'd encourage you to lean into more evocative, physical metaphors. For instance, is the phoneme level less "hard-coupled" and more "fused"? Like an alloy, where the constituent elements are inseparable and form a new, single substance. The morpheme, then, is where this fusion breaks, and we get the first chemical bond: two distinct atoms (form and meaning) linked together. This framing might make the "decoupling" feel less like a failure and more like a critical evolutionary step—the moment language discovers joinery.

The "visible seams" in §13.4 are a fantastic image. This is the payoff. While a phoneme is a river-stone, tumbled into a single smooth object, a construction is a beautiful piece of carpentry. You can admire the whole, but you can also see the dovetail joints and dowel pins. It’s evidence of its own making. Highlighting this "archeology"—the idea that in constructions, we can see the history of how form and meaning were deliberately put together—could provide a powerful 'aha' moment for the reader. It makes the abstract concept of coupling feel tangible, something you can almost trace with your finger.

Finally, the negative case in §13.6 is a smart move for intellectual honesty, but its rhetorical power could be enhanced. You diagnose "academic register" as an "ecosystem label," which is exactly right. To make this resonate, I’d contrast it directly with one of the successful cases. A phoneme is an organism; a construction is an organism; the academic register is a biome. It's not that the components lack function, but they aren't bound into a single homeostatic creature. Showing, not just telling, this would be key. For example, illustrate how quickly the "passive voice" element can be swapped out for an "active voice" one depending on the journal's style guide, without the whole system collapsing. This demonstrates a lack of the tight integration you've so carefully established in the preceding sections.
