# Chapter 4: Homeostatic Property Clusters — Outline

**Working title:** *Kinds without Essences*

**Position in book:** First chapter of Part II ("The Fix"). Follows Ch 3 (nominalist rejection) and precedes Ch 5 (discreteness application).

**Core job:** Introduce the HPC framework from philosophy of biology and show how it applies to grammar. Establish the theoretical machinery that Ch 5–8 will use.

## Opening

The nominalist was right to reject essences. But wrong to conclude that categories lack determinacy. There's a third option, developed in philosophy of biology over the past forty years: categories can be real, stable, and determinate without being defined by necessary and sufficient conditions.

## 4.1 The species problem

- Biology faced this first: what makes a tiger a tiger?
- Pre-Darwinian answer: essences (reproductive isolation was definitional)
- Post-Darwinian problem: species are populations with fuzzy boundaries, horizontal gene transfer, ring species, etc.
- The choice seemed to be: essentialism (false to facts) or nominalism (loses explanatory power)
- Boyd's solution: Homeostatic Property Cluster kinds

## 4.2 What HPC kinds are

- A cluster of properties that *tend to* co-occur
- No single property is necessary or sufficient
- What holds the cluster together: *mechanisms*, not definitions
- Example: tigers cluster {stripes, carnivory, territorial behaviour, specific genome...} not by definition but because developmental and ecological mechanisms produce that bundle
- The mechanisms are causal, not stipulative

## 4.3 The standing-wave image

- A standing wave looks static but is dynamically maintained
- Disturb the system and the wave shifts or dissipates
- Categories as standing waves:
  - Synchronic structure (there's a wave)
  - Diachronic change (wave can move)
  - Mechanism-dependence (turn off energy source → no wave)
  - Boundary gradience (fuzzy edges)
- Heuristic to think with, not a literal claim

## 4.4 Sciences that made the shift

- Biology: species redefined as populations maintained by mechanisms
- Chemistry: elements defined by atomic number (causal-structural), not manifest properties (colour, density)
- The shift made these sciences *more* productive, not less
- Reassurance: abandoning definitional essentialism ≠ abandoning rigour
- Linguistics can make the same move

## 4.5 From biology to grammar

- The parallel: grammatical categories are also clusters maintained by mechanisms
- Properties that cluster for *nouns*: argument-taking, determiner compatibility, plural morphology, referential function...
- None is necessary, none sufficient (see Ch 2's failures)
- What holds the cluster: mechanisms (next section)

## 4.6 The mechanisms (preview)

Brief introduction—Ch 7 develops fully:

- **Acquisition**: Children track statistical regularities that reflect category structure
- **Entrenchment**: High-frequency items anchor categories
- **Interactive alignment**: Speakers converge in conversation
- **Iterated transmission**: Only stable variants survive across generations
- **Functional pressure**: Categories do work; what works, persists

## 4.7 What counts as explanation

- Essentialism: "X behaves this way *because* it's a noun" (circular)
- HPC: "X clusters with nouns because the same mechanisms that maintain N attract X" (causal)
- Mechanism-talk is harder but genuinely explanatory
- The question shifts from "what is X?" to "what maintains X?"

## 4.8 HPC recovers determinacy

- Central theoretical point
- Determinacy grounded in causal structure, not definitions
- A tiger is determinately a tiger because of lineage (causal-historical)
- Grammatical categories: membership is determinate when causal history is determinate
- Boundary cases: where causal pressures are mixed or transitional
- Indeterminacy is real but *localized*—not global fuzziness

## 4.9 Neo-Aristotelian coda

- Boyd's HPC theory sometimes called neo-Aristotelian
- Recovers real natural kinds with genuine explanatory structure
- The homeostatic mechanisms *are* the essence, causally understood
- Ch 2 exonerated Aristotle from vulgar essentialism; this chapter recovers him
- Full circle: real structure, yes—but maintained, not defined

## Figures needed

1. **Property cluster diagram**: Properties radiating from a core, with dashed lines for weaker connections
2. **Standing wave**: Visual metaphor for dynamic stability
3. **Tiger/species example**: How mechanisms maintain the cluster (could be schematic)

## What moves to later chapters

Material currently in the Ch 5 planning notes that belongs *after* this introduction:

- **Ch 5**: Discreteness problem, hyperreal formalization, application to boundaries
- **Ch 6**: Projectibility (why HPC kinds support induction)
- **Ch 7**: Full treatment of mechanisms
- **Ch 8**: Failure modes (thin/fat/negative clustering)

---

## Dependencies

- Must follow Ch 3 (nominalist exit closed)
- Current Ch 5 needs Boyd/Rosch citations to be introduced here first
- The "TODO: Opening section introducing HPC from Boyd/biology" at top of ch05.tex is satisfied by this chapter

## Estimated length

~4,000–5,000 words (12–15 pages). Conceptual orientation chapter, not application-heavy.
