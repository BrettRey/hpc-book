# Physics Foundations Parallel

## Source
Transcript from talk (possibly Sean Carroll or similar), discussing how foundational work in quantum physics — dismissed as "merely philosophical" — produced major practical tools.

## The parallel

| Physics | Linguistics |
|---------|-------------|
| "What does quantum theory actually mean?" | "What are grammatical categories actually?" |
| Dismissed as philosophy, career obstacles for those who pursued it | Often seen as "not real linguistics," marginalized |
| Produced: Bell inequality, no-cloning theorem, GHZ states, teleportation protocols | Produced: ??? (to be determined) |
| Now used in: quantum computing, cryptography, precision measurement | ??? |

## Key quotes from source

> "In terms of input to output, funding going in and important groundbreaking results coming out, I think there are few fields that have been as productive as foundations and philosophy of physics."

> "A lot of these people who worked on these foundational questions saw major career problems. They were warned away from working on these problems."

## Where it might go

1. **Chapter 1** ✓ IMPLEMENTED — in "The impasse" section, after diagnosing the shared blind spot, before chapter previews
2. **Conclusion (Chapter 14?)** — reflect on what the "Bell inequality of linguistics" turned out to be (or might yet be)

## Draft language

### For the introduction:
> Physics offers a parallel. For decades, foundational questions about quantum theory — what measurement means, how entanglement works — were dismissed as philosophy, not physics. Researchers who pursued them faced career obstacles. But the foundational work produced some of the most practically useful results in modern physics: Bell's inequality, the no-cloning theorem, teleportation protocols. Tools now used in quantum computing and cryptography began as questions about what quantum theory *means*.

### For the conclusion:
> We don't know yet what the "Bell inequality of linguistics" will be. But the physics example suggests that foundational clarity can have unexpected practical payoffs. The maintenance view is offered in that spirit: not as a replacement for empirical work, but as an attempt to get clear on what the empirical work is tracking. The payoff may not be obvious in advance — it wasn't for Bell, or for Kochen and Specker. But getting the foundations right tends to matter eventually.
