This looks like a solid outline, but let me give you a little warning from the perspective of someone who’s spent a lifetime watching how academics defend their turf. You have a section here called "Register at the Wrong Grain (Negative Case)." That word "Wrong" is doing a lot of heavy lifting, and it might just lift you right into a fight you don't need. Sociolinguists and stylistic analysts have spent decades defining register. If you walk in and say their unit of analysis is "wrong" because it doesn't fit your homeostatic model, you're just picking a fight. Instead of saying it *fails* your test, say it operates on a different logic. It’s a "loose" social agreement, not a tight causal cluster. It’s not a *failed* natural kind; it’s a *successful* social institution. Treat it with respect, even if you’re distinguishing it from your biological or cognitive kinds.

On that note, I’d be careful with how cleanly you’re stacking these layers—phonemes, morphemes, constructions. We sociologists know that categories are things people *make*, not just things they find. When you talk about "stabilizers" like "dispersion pressure" or "entrenchment," make sure you don't lose the actors. Who is doing the stabilizing? Speakers are. Listeners are. People correcting their kids are. If you make this sound like a machine running on its own ("The Stack"), you lose the reality that language is something people *do* together. The "re-coupling" at the construction level isn't just a mechanical process; it's people using a phrase like *let alone* over and over until it feels right. Keep the agency visible, or your "mechanisms" will start to look like magic spells.

Finally, watch your own "academic passive" while you're critiquing it. You’re using terms like "coupling regime," "quantal regions," and "compositional parallelism." I know you need to sound like a philosopher of science, but don't let the fancy words hide the simple truth: some things stick together tight (sounds), and some things are glued together by habit (phrases). If you can say it simply, say it simply. The "stack" metaphor is fine, but don't let it become a cage. Real life is messy, and if your model looks too perfect, your readers—especially the ones who study the messy parts—are going to start looking for the cracks.
