# Board feedback (Becker) — Sullivan (2016) placement

You’re deciding where to put a *skeptical voice* in a book that has two different rhetorical jobs:

- Chapter 4 is where you *win the reader’s assent* to the maintenance/HPC picture.
- Chapter 8 is where you *show you won’t abuse it*—where you earn trust by saying “no” when “yes” would be easy.

Sullivan belongs mostly in Chapter 8.

## 1) Rhetorical positioning: don’t interrupt the invitation

The opening of Chapter 4 (the Brand/maintenance setup through the Boyd “HPC kinds” paragraph) is doing reader-recruitment. It’s a guided tour into a new way of seeing: “Look, categories can be real without essences because mechanisms keep them going.” That tour needs forward motion.

If you drop Sullivan’s “healthy anti-realism” into that opening, you risk a predictable reader reaction: *“Wait—so even the philosophers think these kinds might not exist?”* Now your clean introduction turns into a debate about whether the foundation is safe. Readers stop walking with you and start cross-examining you.

Becker rule of thumb: put the hard objection where the reader already expects difficulty. That’s Chapter 8.

## 2) Does citing skepticism help or hurt?

It helps *when it functions as a guardrail*, not as a rug-pull.

- **Helps in Chapter 8:** Your opening already names the “inflation problem” (“you start seeing it everywhere”). Sullivan is a perfect “this happens in real science” reinforcement: reliability of a label can masquerade as validity of a kind; shared words can hide divergent mechanisms. Used here, Sullivan increases credibility because you’re not just warning abstractly—you’re showing an adjacent field getting trapped by the same mistake.

- **Hurts in Chapter 4 (opening):** In an intro chapter, skepticism tends to read as authorial uncertainty, even when it’s actually methodological sophistication. The reader hasn’t yet been given enough of your positive machinery to understand *what* the skeptic is skeptical about. So they hear “maybe this doesn’t work,” not “here’s why we need diagnostics.”

So: cite her where skepticism is *useful discipline*, not where it looks like *wavering commitment*.

## 3) Specific placement (paragraph-level)

### Best: Chapter 8 opening, immediately after you define the inflation problem

In `chapters/chapter08.tex`, the cleanest slot is right after the paragraph that defines inflation (around the sentence “If every stable pattern counts as an HPC…”). That’s where a one-sentence Sullivan reference reads as “this problem is real,” not “here’s a new subplot.”

**Placement:** after the paragraph beginning “This is the inflation problem…”

**Move:** one sentence in the main text + citation, or a tight footnote if you want to keep the opening airy.

**Example sentence (main text):**
> A practice-based version of this worry shows up in cognitive neuroscience: investigators can converge on a construct name while studying different phenomena produced by different mechanisms \autocite{Sullivan2016}.

That sentence does three jobs: it (a) backs your warning, (b) keeps the reader moving, and (c) doesn’t force you to litigate neuroscience in the first page.

### Also good: Chapter 8 §8.1, after you broaden to “cognition generally”

Your next natural slot is right after the “Why does linguistics—and cognition generally—generate labels…” question. That’s an explicit invitation to cite an example from cognition science.

**Placement:** after the two-sentence question opening the section.

**Example footnote-style move:**
> (For an extended argument that current neuroscientific practices often fail to support discovery of mechanistic property clusters for cognitive capacities, see \textcite{Sullivan2016}.)

### Optional (small): Chapter 4, but only as a *preview footnote*

If you feel you *must* plant Sullivan in Chapter 4, keep it subordinate—attach it to the first introduction of HPC kinds so it reads as “this framework travels” (and “there are debates”), not as “warning: the whole project might collapse.”

**Placement:** a footnote on the first “HPC kinds” mention (right where you introduce Boyd’s term).

**What the footnote should say (tone):** not “Sullivan shows this fails,” but “Sullivan shows discovery can be hard when practice is uncoordinated—see Chapter 8 for diagnostics.”

**Example (footnote):**
> Versions of the HPC idea have been applied to cognition as “mechanistic property clusters”; Sullivan argues that ordinary neuroscientific practice often lacks the coordination needed to identify such clusters reliably \autocite{Sullivan2016}. Chapter 8 turns this general worry into diagnostics for linguistic categories.

That keeps Chapter 4 doing its job (build the positive picture) while quietly foreshadowing that you’ll later discipline the framework.

## 4) The “how” in one line

Use Sullivan as a *cautionary exemplar* for your inflation/validity theme (Chapter 8), and—if at all in Chapter 4—use her only as a brief signpost that you’ll later show how to avoid the mistake.
