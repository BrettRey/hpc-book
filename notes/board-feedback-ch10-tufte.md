## Summary
You already have the essential data structure: the diagnostics table. Treat it as the core figure. Add at most one small schematic to show the form/function decoupling if the prose needs help, but make it information-dense and restrained.

## Keep / Tighten
- Keep the diagnostics table. It is the chapter's empirical backbone.
- Tighten the table: order determiners by cluster membership (prototypical -> mixed -> non-members). Keep labels short.

## Optional minimal schematic (if needed)
If you want a visual for the two-cluster split, use a small 2x2 grid or scatter:
- X-axis: definiteness strength (familiarity/uniqueness/identifiability).
- Y-axis: form-cluster strength (diagnostic count).
- Plot a few exemplars: "the cat" (high/high), "the hospital" (high form/low definiteness), "Kim" (low form/high definiteness), "dogs" (low/low).
This can be a tiny figure embedded near the split discussion. Avoid Venn diagrams and arrows; they add decoration without data.

## What to avoid
- Avoid a historical timeline unless you have real dates. A story is better than a pseudo-plot.
- Avoid multi-color metaphors. Keep ink focused on the data.
