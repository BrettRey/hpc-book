# Structural Feedback Action Plan

**Source**: External review (Jan 2026), based on README + chapter status  
**Status**: Triaged; ready for implementation

## Priority Actions

### 1. _HPC-kind audit_ template (Ch 8)

**Add as recurring table/checklist at end of Ch 8; reuse an abbreviated version in Part III chapters.**

| Step | Content |
|------|---------|
| 1. Target + scope | What entities/events does C range over? Specify scope: population/register, time slice, and grain (tokens/constructions/categories/meta-categories). |
| 2. Property cluster (profile) | List 8–15 candidate properties (distributional, morphosyntactic, semantic/pragmatic, processing, acquisitional, diachronic, sociolinguistic); mark central vs peripheral; note which covary robustly within the stated scope. |
| 3. Homeostatic stabilizers | Acquisition, entrenchment/use, interactive alignment, iterated transmission, institutional enforcement (if relevant); state what each stabilizer predicts about persistence/repair under perturbation. |
| 4. Projectibility claims | Which inductive generalizations does C license (and for which tasks/data types)? Specify the intended domain of stability and the intended domain of generalisation. |
| 5. Boundary behaviour | Expected borderline cases and expected decouplings (which properties can come apart), with stabilizer-based explanations. |
| 6. Failure-mode gate | Thin: weak clustering/weak stabilizer story. Fat: heterogeneous subclusters or heterogeneous stabilizers with interest-dependent inductions. Negative: primarily defined by absence/contrast-set complement. |
| 7. Falsifiers / stress tests | What pattern would force reclassification (HPC ↔ fat/thin/negative)? What perturbation (register shift, cohort shift, task shift, diachronic window) should reveal decoupling if the diagnosis is wrong? |

**Deliverable**: Figure/table in Ch 8 + abbreviated version in Chs 9–13 (as an end-of-chapter diagnostic output).

### 2. _Predictions_ subsection format (Part III)

**In each of Chs 9–13, add a brief _Predictions_ subsection (3–5 bullets).**

Minimum structure:

- HPC-kind diagnosis predicts X (scoped: population/register, time slice, grain).
- Convenience/nominalist diagnosis predicts Y (what should vary freely under operationalisation changes).
- Essentialist diagnosis predicts Z (what should be invariant; what should have sharp boundaries).
- Tie at least one prediction to each stabilizer where plausible (acquisition, entrenchment, alignment, transmission; institutions where relevant).
- Include at least one discriminating prediction: something that would be hard to reconcile with both HPC and convenience-class diagnoses.

---

### 3. Running example: definiteness

**Add ~150-word _Running example update_ paragraphs to Chs 4–8.**

Rationale:

- Already previewed in Ch 3 (§3.1).
- Ch 6 proper noun/name case rhymes with it.
- Ch 10 is the full treatment.

Each update should state:

1. What this chapter adds to the audit (which step(s) it strengthens).
2. What it predicts about definiteness (and at what scope/grain).
3. What would falsify or force reclassification.

---

### 4. HPC kind ≠ natural kind (Ch 4)

**Add 2–4 pages after the HPC introduction addressing predictable philosophical objections, translated into decision rules for the audit.**

Key sources to engage explicitly:

- Magnus (2012): NK≠HPC — neither necessary nor sufficient.
- Onishi & Serpico (2020): what counts as a homeostatic mechanism?
- Lipski (2020): neo-essentialist misconstruals of HPC.
- Craver (2009): interest-relativity (already cited in Ch 6).

Content targets:

- What you take from the debate (usable constraints).
- What you refuse (requirements that would make linguistic HPC claims impossible or vacuous).
- Audit decision rule: if the only "mechanism" story is analyst convenience/measurement convenience, classify as thin or fat convenience class (not HPC kind).

---

### 5. Term ledger (notes file)

**Create and populate during drafting; run a full consistency pass after Part III is complete.**

Terms to track (minimum set):

- _HPC kind_
- _mechanism_ / _stabilizer_ (and types)
- _homeostasis_ (including what it is not)
- _projectibility_
- thin/fat/negative _convenience class_
- _essentialism_ / _nominalism_ (as used)

**File**: `notes/term-ledger.md`

## Deferred

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Global revision pass | Premature while Chs 11–15 are still being drafted. |
| Explicit "philosopher payoff / linguist payoff" sentences | Prefer to adapt existing summary paragraphs + rely on Part IV to carry this labour. |

---

## Implementation order

1. Create term ledger (scaffolding).
2. Draft HPC kind ≠ natural kind section for Ch 4 (including audit decision rules).
3. Create the _HPC-kind audit_ template for Ch 8 (figure/table + abbreviated version).
4. Add _Predictions_ subsections to Ch 9–10 plans (and keep the format stable through Ch 13).
5. Add _Running example update_ paragraphs to Chs 4–8 (incremental; one per revision pass).
