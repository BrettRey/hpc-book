I find the architectural metaphor of the "Stack" useful, provided we do not lose sight of the biological reality: we are dealing with lineages of reproduced artifacts. Your "coupling gradient" strikes me as a descriptive gloss on a deeper functional necessity. I worry that by framing it purely as "form" versus "meaning," you risk treating these as static essences rather than functional histories.

Regarding **§13.2 (Phonemes)**: You argue they are "hard-coupled" because there is no separable meaning. I would correct this: their *Proper Function* is distinct from their form. A phoneme’s function is differentiation—to distinguish higher-level semantic units. They are not "meaningless"; they are the sub-semantic gears that make meaning possible. The "tight binding" you observe (quantal regions, etc.) is simply the system’s way of ensuring these gears don't slip. If the acoustic form drifts too far, it fails its function of contrast. It is not that form and meaning are fused; it is that the function *requires* strict adherence to form.

On **§13.3 and §13.4 (Morphemes and Constructions)**: Be careful with the term "decoupling." It implies two independent entities drifting apart. In reality, what you are describing is the rise of **Arbitrariness as a Coordination Solution**. The form *-ed* does not "look like" the past; it maps to it because that mapping has been reproduced and stabilized in the lineage. The "re-coupling" in constructions is not a gluing back together of broken parts; it is the establishment of a higher-order lineage where the *unit of reproduction* is the pairing itself. The "seams" you mention are simply evidence that these are composite reproduced items, unlike the atomic phoneme.

Finally, **§13.6 (Register)** is your strongest analytical move. This perfectly illustrates the difference between a **Real Kind** (a substance maintained by a unified causal mechanism, like a specific construction) and a mere **nominal category** (like "Academic Passive"). If "Academic Passive" has no single mechanism of reproduction—if it is just a statistical heap of heterogeneous habits—then it is not a subject for scientific laws. It is a confusion of the investigator, not a natural joint in the world. Stick to this distinction rigorously.
