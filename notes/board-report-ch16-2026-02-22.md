# Advisory Board Report: Chapter 16 (Gauntlet Revamp)

**Date**: 2026-02-22  
**Target**: `chapters/chapter16.tex`  
**Selection basis**: `notes/advisory-board.md` (core theoretical + core packaging mix)

## Selected Reviewers (range and rationale)

- **William Croft** (typology, comparative concepts discipline)
- **Adele Goldberg** (constructional learning and maintenance)
- **Ray Jackendoff** (architectural/interface discipline)
- **Peter Godfrey-Smith** (falsification and mechanism realism)
- **Michael Tomasello** (acquisition timelines and mechanism claims)
- **Deirdre McCloskey** (rhetorical credibility and disciplinary uptake)
- **Carl Zimmer** (reader handrail, concrete scientific storytelling)
- **Edward Tufte** (evidence thresholds, variable-level operationalization)

This set intentionally spans mechanism theory, typology, acquisition, architecture, rhetoric, and evidentiary discipline.

## What They Say About Ch 16

### Convergent points (high agreement)

- The chapter succeeds as a finale only if it acts like a **test protocol**, not a conceptual epilogue.
- One concrete throughline is necessary for readability and discipline; without it, claims look generic.
- Falsifiers are strong in spirit but need explicit **measurement hooks** and decision thresholds.
- Scope must be partitioned cleanly:
language-particular category predictions,
comparative-pattern predictions,
construction-level predictions.

### Reviewer-specific pressure

- **Croft**: keep comparative concepts useful without implying language-particular categories everywhere.
- **Goldberg**: include construction-level predictions explicitly, not as a side remark.
- **Jackendoff**: interpret lag as different update rates across channels, not level primacy.
- **Godfrey-Smith**: preserve hard falsifiers but add a serious downgrading regime before total defeat.
- **Tomasello**: acquisition timelines should appear as one of the empirical tests, not only corpora.
- **McCloskey**: pair strong rhetoric with concrete next-day research consequences.
- **Zimmer**: thread one case from opening to close as a reader handrail.
- **Tufte**: define observable variables and baseline comparisons; state what loss condition triggers downgrade vs defeat.

## Optimal Revision Set (implemented)

1. Strengthened running-case handrail with explicit diagnostics (`\mention{data}` agreement/quantifier/pronominal uptake).  
2. Added comparative-concept null-case sentence (useful comparison without required language-particular category).  
3. Added architecture sentence clarifying lag as rate differences across channels.  
4. Expanded construction-level scope sentence with explicit competing constructions.  
5. Added partial-pressure vs serious-downgrade distinction before full defeat conditions.  
6. Expanded operationalization with concrete variables, model families, and baseline-comparison logic.  
7. Tightened conclusion with an explicit practice consequence: design studies that can make the framework wrong.

## Bottom Line

On this board read, Chapter 16 now behaves like a gauntlet chapter rather than a leftovers chapter. The chapter's success condition is now empirical risk: named predictions, named defeat conditions, and named analysis pathways.
