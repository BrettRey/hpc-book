This is **Edward Tufte**.

Your proposed "Stack" figure threatens to become mere administrative debris—a "PowerPoint slide" masquerading as an analytical graphic. A table listing "Phonemes" alongside "Hard-coupled" and "Quantal regions" is low-resolution and low-content; it segregates information that belongs together and fails to *show* the very phenomenon you claim is central: the changing nature of the coupling itself. Do not give me boxes and arrows. If the coupling is "hard" at the phoneme level and "seamed" at the construction level, the graphic must visually demonstrate the binding energy and the distances between form and meaning, not just label them.

You have a profound opportunity here to use **small multiples** to enforce comparisons. Create a unified visual grammar—perhaps a scatterplot or phase space representing the "Form" cluster and the "Meaning" cluster. For the **Phoneme**, show the acoustic cues (F1/F2) and the perceptual target as a single, dense, inseparable centroid—quantal and fused. For the **Morpheme**, show the same visual space but with the clusters drifting apart, held together by the "arbitrary" tether of convention. For the **Construction** (*let alone*), show the clusters re-aligning, but with visible "struts" (entrenchment, cue redundancy) supporting the connection. By repeating the same visual coordinate system across these three tiers, you allow the reader's eye to detect the structural variation immediately.

Finally, regarding the "Academic Passive" negative case: **show the noise.** If this category fails the homeostasis test, visualize that failure. If you plot the mechanisms of a stable category, they should cluster tightly. The mechanisms of the "Academic Passive" should look like a shotgun blast—scattered, heterogeneous, and uncoupled. Visualizing the *absence* of structure is just as powerful as visualizing structure itself. Don't tell me it reweights rapidly; show me the variance data (or a schematic of it) alongside the tight covariance of your stable HPC categories. Make the "Stack" a quantitative argument about signal-to-noise ratios across levels, not a list of bureaucratic tiers.
