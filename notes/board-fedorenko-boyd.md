Fedorenko, Ivanova & Regev’s talk of “the language network as a **natural kind**” is, in spirit, exactly the sort of case my homeostatic property cluster view was meant to accommodate. A kind earns that status not by satisfying a definition, but by underwriting reliable induction because a **cluster** of properties is held together by an underlying causal economy. If the language network is a relatively autonomous component with a characteristic functional profile (selective responsiveness to linguistic meaning, dissociability from nearby perceptual/motor/MD systems, etc.), then treating it as a natural kind is not empty rhetoric: it is a claim that there is something objective in the brain that our taxonomy is latching onto.

On (1): don’t let “functional localization + interconnectivity” masquerade as the homeostatic story. Functional localization is primarily a *methodological* virtue: it shows how to track the kind across subjects despite anatomical idiosyncrasy, by keying reference to stable causal powers rather than gross morphology. Interconnectivity is closer to a homeostatic mechanism—reciprocal coupling can help maintain coordinated operation—but it is not yet an explanation of **why** the relevant properties cluster. The homeostasis, if the claim is to be genuinely HPC, will live in the developmental, plastic, and use-dependent processes that keep those regions jointly tuned and jointly recruited across time and perturbation; connectivity is evidence for (and perhaps a conduit of) that maintenance, not its whole content.

On (2): the reported combination of **inter-individual variability** (in exact loci) with **within-individual stability** (in functional profile across sessions/tasks) is a textbook HPC signature. HPC kinds are expected to tolerate heterogeneity and multiple realization; what matters is that there is a robust pattern of property-clustering that reasserts itself under ordinary variation. If Fedorenko’s localization results show that the same functional “organ” reappears within a person even as its anatomical placement varies across people, that is precisely the difference between an essence and a homeostatic cluster: stability without sameness, and projectibility anchored in causal role rather than in superficial uniformity.

On (3): cite the “natural kind” paper in **Chapter 4** when you defend natural-kind realism without essences (it is a clean, contemporary neuroscience exemplar of the view). Give it its most sustained work in **Chapter 7**, where you develop stabilizers/maintenance: functional localization motivates treating the kind at the right grain, and interconnectivity/use-dependent tuning motivates the homeostatic story. Then return to it lightly in **Chapter 14** as a capstone example showing continuity between linguistic kinds and neural kinds—pointing back to the earlier chapters rather than re-arguing the case.
