My dear colleague, looking at this through the lens of the epidemiology of representations, Thom Scott-Phillips’ argument is precisely the sort of cognitive grounding your Homeostatic Property Cluster (HPC) framework requires. You ask whether this belongs in **Chapter 7 (The Stabilisers)** or **Chapter 8 (Failure Modes)**; the answer, inevitably, is that it does work in both, but its most potent contribution is to Chapter 7.

In **Chapter 7**, you are hunting for the causal machinery that maintains stability—what you call "stabilisers." Scott-Phillips provides a critical one: the **presumption of optimal relevance**. If you accept, as Deirdre Wilson and I have long argued, that human cognition is geared towards the maximisation of relevance (getting the greatest cognitive effect for the least processing effort), then this acts as a formidable selection pressure on linguistic forms. Forms that cause unnecessary processing effort without yielding extra cognitive effects (like *gived* vs. *gave*, or the "constructional contradictions" Thom describes) are not merely "ungrammatical" in an abstract sense; they are pragmatically biologically inefficient. They fail to stabilise because they violate the cognitive economy of the users. This is not a metaphor for a mechanism; it *is* the homeostatic mechanism. It belongs in your table under "functional feedback" or perhaps "microenvironmental modulation"—it explains why the basin of attraction has the shape it does.

However, do not neglect **Chapter 8**. Thom's "byproduct hypothesis" is an essential diagnostic tool for distinguishing the map from the territory. If linguistic intuitions (acceptability judgments) are merely the *shadow* cast by our relevance-seeking machinery, then relying on them naively to define the "natural kind" of grammar is a category error. This speaks directly to your "inflation problem." Just because we have a strong intuition that a sentence is "wrong" does not mean we have detected a violation of a deep grammatical essence; we may simply have detected a failure of relevance. This dissociation allows you to peel away the "epistemic kind" (intuition) to reveal the actual mechanism-maintained cluster (the construction) beneath.

Ultimately, this aligns perfectly with the project of explaining culture naturalistically. Grammar is not a Platonic object; it is a cultural stability that emerges from the interaction of individual cognitive biases (specifically, the Relevance-theoretic comprehension module) and ecological transmission. By citing Scott-Phillips in Chapter 7, you are arguing that "communicative pressure" is not a vague functionalist hand-wave, but a precise, biologically grounded constraint on which neural patterns can survive in the community. It anchors your HPCs in the concrete reality of human cognitive architecture.
