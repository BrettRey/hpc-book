## 1. MacKenzie 2019 — Perturbing the Community Grammar

**Main Thesis:**
Individual differences in constraint patterns resemble the parameters on which communities diverge. This opens possibility that models of sound change can extend to *constraint change*.

**Key Ideas for HPC Book:**

1. **Communities share variables but differ in constraints**
   - Different speech communities can have the SAME variable but DIFFERENT constraint patterns
   - Examples: TD-deletion in York (UK) vs American English — same variable, different morphological class effects
   - goose-fronting before /l/ in Manchester vs elsewhere — same variable, different environmental conditioning

2. **Constraint change = mechanism change**
   - When constraints differ across communities, the STABILISING MECHANISMS have diverged
   - This is exactly the HPC story: different mechanism profiles produce different category behaviours

3. **Individual differences → community divergence**
   - Individual cognitive differences in articulation/perception seed constraint change
   - Parallels the "activation states" framing: individual variation → community-level stable stratification

4. **Community-oriented learning as filter**
   - Speakers are under pressure to reject individual idiosyncrasies
   - Only innovations that survive this filter get taken up
   - This is a TRANSMISSION MECHANISM: community norms act as stabilisers

**Quotable:**
> "Community-level divergence in constraints on a shared variable has long been recognized, but their actuation has never been addressed. Why does pre-pausal position affect TD in one way in Philadelphia and in a different way in New York City?"

**Connection to Ch7:**
This connects directly to the multi-level stabilisation story. Constraints are stabilised at community level; individual differences are the raw material; transmission filters what persists.

## 2. Lavandera 1978 — Where Does the Sociolinguistic Variable Stop?

**Main Thesis:**
The concept of "sociolinguistic variable" should NOT be extended beyond phonology without modification, because non-phonological variables (syntactic, morphological) require interpretation of *meaning differences*, not just frequency differences.

**Key Ideas for HPC Book:**

1. **Different levels require different tools**
   - Phonological variables: form varies, referential meaning constant
   - Syntactic variables: form varies, but meaning may also vary
   - The tools that handle phonological variation "cannot easily be extended" to syntax

2. **Social/stylistic meaning vs referential meaning**
   - Phonological variables carry social/stylistic significance without referential change
   - Syntactic alternations often involve different referential meanings
   - "Where that specific tool, the sociolinguistic variable, stops" — level-relative methodology

3. **Challenge to uniform mechanism application**
   - This is a counterpoint to MacKenzie's later argument
   - Lavandera argues that DIFFERENT LEVELS require DIFFERENT ANALYSES
   - HPC response: same general mechanism types, but different profiles at different levels

**Quotable:**
> "All I will argue is that the tools that handle phonological variation cannot easily be extended to the analysis of syntactic variation. Therefore my question is not where variation stops... but rather where that specific tool, the sociolinguistic variable, stops."

**Connection to Ch7:**
This is the classic statement of "level matters" for sociolinguistic analysis. The HPC response: same mechanism types operate at all levels, but with different weights and interactions. Lavandera's worry is methodological; HPC provides the ontological framework.

## 3. Weiner & Labov 1983 — Constraints on the Agentless Passive

**Main Thesis:**
The choice between active and passive voice in spontaneous speech is constrained primarily by LINGUISTIC factors (discourse prominence, given/new), not SOCIAL factors (class, sex, ethnicity).

**Key Ideas for HPC Book:**

1. **Syntactic variation is real and conditioned**
   - Passive/active alternation shows systematic conditioning
   - NOT random, NOT purely stylistic
   - The SAME mechanisms (discourse factors, information structure) operate across speakers

2. **Social factors have little effect on syntactic choice**
   - Sex, class, ethnicity: minimal effects on passive usage
   - Internal linguistic constraints dominate
   - This supports Lavandera's concern: syntactic variation ≠ phonological variation

3. **"Meaning" narrowly construed**
   - Active and passive treated as TRUTH-CONDITIONALLY EQUIVALENT
   - Differences are "focus or emphasis" not referential meaning
   - This allows the variable rule framework to apply

4. **Coreference as key constraint**
   - Agentless passive strongly favoured when subject is coreferent with underlying object
   - This is a PROCESSING mechanism: discourse coherence drives syntactic choice

**Quotable:**
> "Variable elements are found at all levels of linguistic structure. Some variation is the result of articulatory constraints on grammatical processes; some reflects a variable recognition of grammatical boundaries; some appears to be the residue of historical processes which persists long after the social conditions that gave rise to it have disappeared."

**Connection to Ch7:**
This demonstrates that syntactic categories are STABILISED BY PROCESSING MECHANISMS (discourse coherence, coreference) not social mechanisms. Different mechanism profile → different variation pattern. Supports multi-mechanism realism.

## 4. Levon & Buchstaller 2015 — Perception, Cognition, and Linguistic Structure

**Main Thesis:**
Tests whether the "Interface Principle" (morphosyntactic variables are less socially salient than phonetic variables) holds up under experimental perception testing.

**Key Ideas for HPC Book:**

1. **The Interface Principle**
   - Claim: "abstract" features (syntax, morphology) are less available to social evaluation than "surface" features (phonetics)
   - Attributed to the "sociolinguistic monitor" — speakers monitor surface forms but not deep structure

2. **Counter-evidence from perception experiments**
   - Listeners CAN evaluate morphosyntactic variables (Northern Subject Rule)
   - The distinction isn't binary (surface/deep) but gradient and context-sensitive
   - Salience is DYNAMIC, not static

3. **Cognitive style moderates perception**
   - Individual differences in cognitive style affect how listeners process sociolinguistic variation
   - "Field-independent" vs "field-dependent" cognition → different sensitivity to linguistic structure
   - This is the ACTIVATION STATE idea for perception: same variable, different perceptual state depending on cognitive ecology

4. **Social salience as empirical question**
   - Should be measured, not assumed
   - Different levels may differ in salience FOR DIFFERENT REASONS (not because of intrinsic depth)

**Quotable:**
> "The belief that we can model listeners' perceptual capacity based on patterns of speech production alone relies on a model of sociolinguistic cognition that views linguistic practice as a direct reflex of underlying evaluations. There is, however, a growing body of evidence... that the relationship between evaluation and behavior is mediated by various external factors."

**Connection to Ch7:**
This connects directly to the robustness criteria: salience is not intrinsic but emerges from mechanism interactions. The level distinction (phonological/syntactic) is not categorical but gradient. Supports the claim that sociolinguistic mechanisms operate at all levels but with different profiles.

## Summary Table

| Paper | Level Focus | Key Claim | HPC Relevance |
|-------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| MacKenzie 2019 | Phonology | Individual differences → constraint change | Same mechanisms, individual variation as seed |
| Lavandera 1978 | Syntax vs phonology | Tools don't transfer across levels | Level-relative methodology needed |
| Weiner & Labov 1983 | Syntax (passive) | Syntactic variation is processing-driven | Processing mechanisms stabilise syntax |
| Levon & Buchstaller 2015 | Perception | Salience is dynamic, not level-determined | Robustness criteria apply across levels |

## Best Examples for Chapter 7

1. **Community constraint divergence** (MacKenzie): York vs American TD-deletion
2. **Syntactic variable** (Weiner & Labov): passive/active alternation driven by coreference
3. **French *on/nous*** (Lavandera cites Laberge): already in chapter, confirms sociolinguistic framing
4. **Perception experiments** (Levon & Buchstaller): TH-fronting vs Northern Subject Rule — perception is mechanism-dependent
