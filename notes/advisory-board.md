## Theoretical Board

### Philosophy of science/biology

**Richard Boyd** — The originator of HPC theory. Clarifies what the theory was designed to do versus what I'm extending it to do. Recent work connects HPC to moral realism, which parallels the move from natural kinds to linguistic kinds.

**Ruth Millikan** — Teleosemantics. Her proper-function framework grounds normativity in causal history, not definitions. Would push on whether grammatical categories have proper functions in her technical sense. *Language: A Biological Model* is directly relevant.

**John Dupré** — Promiscuous realism. Argues for pluralism about biological kinds without sliding into nominalism. Would stress-test whether I'm committed to *one* correct category scheme or many.

### Historical ontology / sociology of classification

**Ian Hacking** — *Historical Ontology*, *The Social Construction of What?* Distinguishes natural kinds from human kinds; tracks "looping effects" where classifications change the things classified. Grammatical categories might be intermediate. Would ask whether linguistic categories loop.

**Geoffrey Bowker & Susan Leigh Star** (joint) — *Sorting Things Out*. Study how classification schemes get built into infrastructure and become invisible. The point about textbooks freezing architecture and parsers demanding discrete categories is their territory.

### Linguistics (mechanism-friendly)

**John Joseph** — History of linguistics, language ideology. Already on board.

**Adele Goldberg** — Construction grammar. Already thinking about how constructions are learned, stored, and generalized without recourse to innate categories. Natural ally, which means she can identify where the argument is too easy on itself.

**William Croft** — *Radical Construction Grammar*. Argues that cross-linguistic categories don't exist. Would push back on whether HPC saves cross-linguistic categories or whether I should let them go.

**Joan Bybee** — Grammaticalization, frequency effects, emergent grammar. The *will* example is her territory. Would ground the diachronic argument in detailed mechanism.

### Linguistics (productive friction)

**Ray Jackendoff** — Parallel architecture. Generative but not Minimalist. Would steelman the formalist position without ideological baggage. His interface work might actually *support* the cluster view.

**Paul Postal** — The unreconstructed essentialist. Will tell me I'm wrong and exactly why. Genuine opposition sharpens argument.

### Cognitive science

**Eleanor Rosch** — Invented prototype theory but has criticized its misapplication. Would clarify what prototypes can and can't explain. Might argue I'm reinventing her wheel.

**Nick Chater** — *The Mind is Flat*. Thinks about how the mind constructs categories on the fly. Would ask whether HPC categories are psychologically real or analyst's constructs.

### Biology (for the parallel)

**Ernst Mayr** (d. 2005) — Coined "population thinking" as the alternative to typological thinking. Would ensure the biological parallel is load-bearing, not decorative.

**Peter Godfrey-Smith** — *Philosophy of Biology*, *Other Minds*. Would audit whether mechanisms maintaining species cohesion have genuine analogues in language or whether the parallel is merely structural.

### Social mechanisms

**Joseph Heath** — Already on board.

### Wildcard

**Douglas Hofstadter** — *Surfaces and Essences*. Argues that analogy is the core of cognition. Would ask whether the mechanisms bottom out in analogy, and whether HPC is dressed-up family resemblance.

### Experimentalists / psycholinguists

**Michael Tomasello** — Language acquisition without innate categories. Usage-based learning. Would ground the acquisition-pathway mechanism in developmental data.

**Maryellen MacDonald** — Sentence processing, experience-based learning. Studies how distributional information shapes grammatical knowledge online.

**Ewa Dąbrowska** — Individual differences in grammatical knowledge. Her work shows that "the grammar" varies across speakers in ways essentialism can't accommodate.

**Kara Federmeier** — ERPs and semantic/syntactic category processing. Would ask what neural signatures distinguish HPC categories from classical ones.

### Computational linguistics / NLP

**Emily Bender** — Critic of NLP's theoretical assumptions. *The Language Model Octopus*. Would push on whether distributed representations are genuinely non-essentialist or essentialist categories in disguise.

**Chris Manning** — Foundational NLP, now neural methods. Has thought about what linguistic structure neural models learn. Would ask what it would mean to build an HPC-compliant parser.

**Tal Linzen** — Studies what neural language models know about syntax. Could test whether models trained on raw text learn HPC-like clusters or discrete categories.

## Packaging Board

### Rhetoric / argumentation

**Wayne Booth** (d. 2005) — *The Rhetoric of Fiction*. Thought about how arguments earn trust. Would help calibrate when to implicate the reader and when to give them distance.

**Jeanne Fahnestock** — *Rhetorical Figures in Science*. Studies how figural language does argumentative work. The Smilodon/Thylacosmilus move is a figura. Would audit figures for whether they're doing the work I think they're doing.

**Deirdre McCloskey** — *The Rhetoric of Economics*. Knows how disciplines protect themselves from critique and how to write inside a discipline while subverting it. Would tell me when I sound like a crank and when I sound like a prophet.

### Editors

**Wendy Lesser** — Founder of *The Threepenny Review*. Has a feel for when academic argument needs more flesh and when it's overwritten. Would cut throat-clearing and protect best sentences.

**Edward Mendelson** — Auden's literary executor. Edits with a sense of intellectual architecture. Would ask whether the chapter sequence performs the move from essentialism to HPC or merely describes it.

**John McPhee** (d. 2024) — Master of structure. *Draft No. 4*. Would push on whether each section earns its place or whether some are furniture.

### Science communication

**Steven Pinker** — *The Sense of Style*. Would tell me what a non-linguist needs to understand the argument. Would also disagree with the framework, which is useful.

**Carl Zimmer** — Already cited. Has a gift for making mechanism-talk vivid. Would help find the concrete image that makes "homeostatic property cluster" feel like a thing in the world.

**Radiolab model (Jad Abumrad & Robert Krulwich)** — Start with puzzle, move through apparent explanations, reveal why they fail, arrive somewhere unexpected. Would push on pacing and where the reveals land.

### Marketing / positioning

**Seth Godin** — What's the one sentence that makes someone pick up this book? Would force me to find the hook that travels without the argument.

**Rory Sutherland** — Reframing. Is this "why linguistics is broken" (threatening) or "how to finally see what you've been looking at" (revelatory)?

**Ryan Holiday** — Marketed philosophy to mass audiences. Would ask about the physical object, covers, blurbs, excerpts.

### Visual presentation

**Edward Tufte** — *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*. Would ask whether each figure earns its space. Hates chartjunk.

**Nigel Holmes** — Infographics. More playful than Tufte, willing to use visual metaphor. If I need a figure that makes HPC instantly graspable, he'd find it.

### Paradigm shifts

**Thomas Kuhn** (d. 1996) — Would ask what would make the crisis visible, and whether the book is normal science, revolutionary science, or philosophy of science.

**Howard Becker** — *Writing for Social Scientists*. Thinks about how academic communities maintain themselves. Advice: don't attack the tribe; show them something they couldn't see before.

**Bruno Latour** (d. 2022) — Would ask whether "essentialism" is a theory linguists hold or a practice distributed across textbooks, software, annotation schemes, funding structures.

### Wildcards

**Errol Morris** — Documentary filmmaker. Would ask how I present the essentialists — as villains, as victims of their framework, as reasonable people who made a mistake anyone would make?

**George Lakoff** — If asking readers to shift from "definitions" to "mechanisms," that's a conceptual metaphor shift. What's the new metaphor? "Categories are standing waves"?
