Here is a review of your Chapter 13 Implementation Plan, written from my perspective as a philosopher of biology committed to promiscuous realism and process ontology.

### Feedback on Chapter 13: "The Stack"
**From:** John Dupré
**Subject:** The risks of forcing a unified ontology

I worry you are falling into a classic reductionist trap here, despite your best intentions. Your "Core Claim" that the HPC framework is "scale-invariant" smacks of a desire for a Grand Unified Theory that rarely survives contact with biological—or in this case, linguistic—reality. In biology, the mechanisms that stabilize a species are fundamentally different from those that stabilize a cell type or an ecosystem. While I appreciate the attempt to use the HPC framework as a common language, you must be careful not to flatten the ontological diversity of your subject matter. Are phonemes, morphemes, and constructions *really* the same kind of "kind," or are you just squinting until they look similar?

Specifically, your treatment of **Phonology (§13.2)** as "hard-coupled" strikes me as dangerously close to essentialism. You say "the acoustic pattern *is* the category," but surely the acoustic reality is a messy, continuous variable, and the "category" is an abstraction imposed by the perceptual system or the linguistic community? If I categorize a sound as /t/, and a physicist categorizes it as a burst of noise, we are both right relative to our interests. By anchoring the phoneme so tightly to physical parameters (quantal regions), you risk ignoring the *promiscuity* of phonological categorization—how the same physical sound can be different phonemes in different dialects or sociolinguistic contexts. The stability here isn't just physical; it’s interactional.

Regarding the **"Stack" (§13.5)** and the **Register (§13.6)** negative case: I caution you against delegitimizing the "Academic Passive" simply because it fails your homeostasis test. This is the core of promiscuous realism: a category like "Academic Register" might be perfectly real and causally potent for a sociologist studying gatekeeping, even if it is a "mushy" bundle for a syntactician. If your framework implies that only homeostatic property clusters are "real," you are being too restrictive. You should frame this not as "Register is not a kind," but as "Register is a different *sort* of kind," stabilized by institutional norms rather than cognitive or grammatical feedback loops.

Finally, a note on **Process**: I am glad to see you focusing on *mechanisms* (stabilizers), but ensure you treat these levels as dynamic processes, not static tiers. In biology, we don't just have a "stack" of cells, tissues, and organs; we have dynamic flows where higher levels constrain lower levels (downward causation). Does your "Stack" allow for the constructional level to reshape the phonological level? If not, your hierarchy is too rigid. Realism requires acknowledging that the world is often a disorder of overlapping, partially integrated processes, not a neat layer cake.
