# Revision Plan: LLM Feedback Synthesis

**Date:** December 16, 2025  
**Sources:** Kimi, Grok, ChatGPT feedback on Chs 1–8

## Convergent Themes (All Three Agree)

| Issue | Consensus | Priority |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Core argument is strong** | HPC framework is field-defining; maintain the spine | N/A |
| **Ch 5 hyperreals need accessibility** | Add "why not fuzzy logic?" sidebar; relocate derivations to appendix | HIGH |
| **Ch 7 too long** | Split into two chapters; "whose" case underdeveloped | MEDIUM |
| **Diagnostics arrive late** | Preview two-diagnostic framework in Ch 4 or early Ch 6 | HIGH |
| **English-heavy** | Add one non-IE deep case study | MEDIUM |
| **Placeholders** | Fix "Chapter ??" references | EASY |
| **Glossary needed** | Terminology density high | LOW |

## Divergent / Unique Points

| Source | Suggestion | My Assessment |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Kimi | Add "fragmented" failure mode (cattle, fun) | Worth considering—subtype of "fat" but distinct |
| Kimi | Replace "whose" with dative alternation | Possibly—but "whose" is theoretically important for filler-gap |
| Kimi | Computational appendix (hyperreal learner) | Too ambitious for this book; park for future |
| Grok | Fix "termmaintenance view" typo | EASY—do immediately |
| Grok | Add usage note for category/class distinction | EASY—add to Ch 2 or Ch 4 |
| Grok | Typology mini-application at end of Ch 8 | Good idea—one worked example with typological workflow |
| ChatGPT | AI assistance may invite scrutiny | Already addressed in appendix; no action |

## Recommendations to Ignore or Defer

1. **Computational appendix** (Kimi) — Too ambitious; the book is philosophical, not computational.
2. **Replace "whose"** (Kimi) — Keep it; it's the cognitive-mechanism counterpart to quotatives (social).
3. **Add ASL/Swahili/Mandarin primary data** (Kimi) — Defer to Part III; Welsh singulatives in Ch 9 partially address this.
4. **Experimental validation** (Kimi/ChatGPT) — Corpus + computational is sufficient for this book's scope.

## Proposed Revision Plan

### Tier 1: Quick Fixes ✅ COMPLETE

All items already addressed in current version:

- [x] ~~Fix "termmaintenance view" typo~~ — Not found (already fixed or older draft issue)
- [x] ~~Fix "Chapter ??" placeholders~~ — Not found
- [x] ~~Add usage note for category/class distinction~~ — Already in Ch 2, line 54: "I reserve *category* for natural kinds throughout"

### Tier 2: Structural (Next Session)

- [x] **Preview two diagnostics earlier** — DONE: Added paragraph in Ch 6 opening (lines 22-23) previewing projectibility + perturbation-sensitivity
- [ ] **Ch 5 accessibility pass** — Add sidebar "Why hyperreals? Why not fuzzy logic?" at start of §5.2; consider moving derivational texture to appendix

### Tier 3: Chapter Reorganization (Longer-term)

- [ ] **Evaluate Ch 7 split** — Is it still 35+ pages? If so, consider "Social Mechanisms: Quotatives" + "Cognitive Mechanisms: Filler-Gaps"
- [ ] **Strengthen "whose" case** — Add more empirical grounding (Processing evidence? Constraint profiles?)
- [ ] **Ch 8 reorder** — Consider moving diagnostics to start of Part II as methodological interlude

### Tier 4: Expansion (Part III)

- [ ] **Ch 9 (Countability)** — Already drafted; apply diagnostics explicitly
- [ ] **Non-IE case study** — Welsh singulatives partially there; consider expanding or adding Mandarin classifiers in Ch 12
- [ ] **Fragmented failure mode** — Add to Ch 8 or as note for future edition

### Tier 5: Polish (Pre-Publication)

- [x] Add glossary — DONE: Infrastructure added (glossaries-extra), 5 sample entries, glossary prints in backmatter
- [x] Add triple index — DONE: Subject, Names, Lexical indices with sample tags in Chs 1, 2, 4
- [ ] Cross-reference audit for forward refs to Part III/IV
- [ ] Ensure AI appendix addresses all concerns

## My Recommendations

**Do now (Tier 1):** The typos and placeholders undermine perceived completeness.

**Do soon (Tier 2):** The diagnostics-preview is high-value, low-effort. The Ch 5 sidebar is important for audience breadth.

**Evaluate carefully (Tier 3):** The Ch 7 split depends on current length. The "whose" case is theoretically important—strengthen rather than replace.

**Defer (Tier 4-5):** Non-IE expansion can happen organically in Part III chapters. Glossary is late-stage polish.

## Questions for You

1. Is Ch 7 still 35+ pages, or has it been trimmed?
2. Do you want to prioritize the diagnostics-preview in Ch 4/6 now, or wait until Part III drafting?
3. The "fragmented" failure mode (cattle, fun as competing mechanisms) — worth adding to Ch 8, or note for future?
