# Eleanor Rosch Board Feedback: Chapter 11 — Word Classes

## On HPC and Prototype Structure

Your HPC framework and prototype theory aren't in tension—they're asking different questions. Prototypes answer the *cognitive* question: how do speakers organize exemplars? HPC answers the *metaphysical* question: what stabilizes that organization across populations and time? The noun prototype (concrete, countable, agent) exists because mechanisms—acquisition patterns, discourse frequency, grammatical entrenchment—pull tokens toward that cluster. But the prototype itself is an *emergent summary*, not the mechanism. This is exactly right. Don't collapse them.

The risk: treating the prototype as explanatory. It isn't. It's what needs explaining.

## On Gradience and Discreteness

Word class membership should be *computationally discrete* but *judgmentally gradient*. Speakers can accept a noun functioning as a verb (*to google*) without dissolving the noun category. This is your phase-transition model from Chapter 5 applied perfectly. The category persists because the underlying mechanisms—morphological agreement, distributional patterns, syntactic selection—remain stable. Gradual judgments don't entail fuzzy kinds. Include this explicitly: degrees of confidence don't entail degrees of membership.

The adjective-adverb split is fascinating precisely because it reveals *different maintenance regimes*. Adjectives stay tight (predicative, attributive, degree marking). Adverbs scatter (adverbial phrase modifiers, focus particles, discourse markers). This isn't category failure; it's different architectural equilibria. Document the mechanisms keeping each in place—or failing to.

## On Categorization Evidence

You need experimental work that most linguists ignore:

1. **Acquisition trajectories:** Do children acquire noun and verb properties in clusters, or separately? If clustered, that's mechanism evidence. Tomasello's work here is essential.

2. **Cross-linguistic learning:** Do L2 learners transfer noun-ness as a bundle or decompose it? Gradual transfer suggests homeostatic coupling.

3. **Aphasia and dissociation:** Can brain damage separate noun-ness from verb-ness? Intact dissociations suggest looser clustering than we assume.

4. **Novel coinage experiments:** Present speakers with phonologically transparent nonce words in noun vs. verb frames. How much of the prototype transfers? This taps projectibility directly.

These aren't illustrations. They're evidence that a *mechanism* exists—not just that a prototype does.
