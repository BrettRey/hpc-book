`\label{ch:homeostasis}`

## Part A: What the Chapter Must Do

### From Previous Chapters

Chapter 6 ends with:
> "The label names the island, not the volcano. But we've talked about mechanisms as if they were self-explanatory. They aren't. What exactly maintains the island? What processes stabilise the clustering, ensure that new instances resemble old ones, transmit the pattern across speakers and generations? The next chapter opens the black box."

Chapter 6 introduces but doesn't develop:
- **Entrenchment** (Polish aspect: 90% of verbs prefer one form)
- **Tense-conditioning** (F1 0.95/0.90 for aspect prediction from tense)
- **Terrain/constraint-landscape language** (Chater-compliant)
- **Bidirectionality** (aspect→verb and verb→aspect both active)

### Core Question
What exactly are the mechanisms, and what kind of thing is a mechanism?

---

## Part B: What Kind of Thing Is a Mechanism?

### Five Compatible Framings

1. **Mechanisms as organised causal processes**
   - Most common philosophy-of-science view: organised set of parts/activities producing a phenomenon
   - Level-dependent: neural circuit, biochemical cascade, social pipeline, learning dynamic
   - HPC leans on this: mechanisms are whatever organised causal structure keeps the cluster co-instantiating

2. **Mechanisms as "real patterns" rather than essences**
   - Realist without making them micro-essences
   - A mechanism = stable pattern of causal organisation supporting counterfactuals and interventions

3. **Mechanisms can themselves be HPC kinds** (recursive option)
   - Mechanism types (entrenchment, alignment, etc.) need not have strict N&S definitions
   - Could be cluster of causal features tending to recur across contexts
   - No sharp boundary required for explanatory or real status

4. **Multi-mechanism realism**
   - Naturally pluralist: category maintained by several overlapping mechanisms, none individually necessary
   - "What kind of thing is the mechanism?" → contributory causal strand in braided stabilising story

5. **Model-first humility**
   - Mechanisms partly discovered, partly modelled
   - Commit to *something* in causal structure doing stabilising, even if taxonomy is rough

### One-liner
> Mechanisms are the stabilising causal patterns we are warranted in positing because they make the clustering and its projectibility non-accidental.

---

## Part C: The Mechanism Inventory

### Primary Framework: By Timescale

**Fastest (milliseconds): Processing**
- Bidirectional inference (comprehension ↔ production)
- Priming effects
- Processing costs for violations

**Intermediate (years): Acquisition and Entrenchment**
- Schema extension (learners generalize from partial patterns)
- Frequency-based entrenchment (Bybee 2010)
- **Pre-emption:** Entrenchment is competitive; a deep rut doesn't just guide traffic, it drains traffic from alternative paths. (See the Left Branch Extraction case in §8.4 for how this creates "impossible" gaps.)
- Paradigmatic pressure (regularisation toward dominant patterns)

**Slowest (decades): Institutional Norms**
- Editorial practice, style guides
- Schooling and standardisation
- Orthographic conventions

### Secondary Dimension: Internal/External (Miller 2021)

**Internal (individual) mechanisms:**
- Mental lexicon retrieval
- Recognition/interpretation
- Derivation consistency

**External (social) mechanisms:**
- Performance standards (Tolerance Principle)
- Community norms
- Register-specific standards

**Critical insight:** Neither internal nor external alone is sufficient — both required together.

### The Five Core Mechanisms (from Ch 1/5 preview)

1. **Acquisition** — how clusters are learned from input
2. **Entrenchment** — how frequency deepens attractors
3. **Alignment** — how speakers coordinate in interaction (Pickering & Garrod)
4. **Transmission** — how patterns propagate across generations (Kirby)
5. **Functional pressure** — which distinctions are communicatively useful

**Interaction:** "The fast loop generates usage patterns; the slow loop crystallises them into community standards"

### Level-Specific Mechanisms

**Phonemes:**
- Quantal stability (articulatory "sweet spots")
- Dispersion pressure
- Perceptual magnets

**Words:**
- Orthographic standardisation
- Editorial norms
- Register/genre licensing

**Constructions:**
- Cue redundancy
- Normative pressure

---

## Part D: Hidden Commitments

### 1. Process ontology
Category ≠ static object. Category = dynamically sustained attractor in population-level causal field.

### 2. Interventionist realism
> A kind is real to the extent that manipulating (or tracking) it reliably changes expectations about downstream properties.
- Real kinds = control-relevant partitions, not just descriptive clusters

### 3. Normatively-inflected naturalism
- Competence norms are emergent ecological facts
- Way to talk about grammaticality without essences AND without collapsing into taste

### 4. Measurable metaphysics
- Kindhood as gradient and quantifiable via projectibility metrics
- Operational teeth: entropy reduction, cross-context generalisation accuracy, inter-speaker agreement

### 5. Social ontology of grammar
- Grammatical kinds = partially social kinds (stabilized by coordination equilibria)
- Standard varieties produce sharper category effects; stigma/prestige act like selection pressures

### 6. Plural groundings of "the same" category
- "Noun" as convergent kind: real but multiply realised across typological space
- Crosslinguistic sameness = functional-mechanistic overlap, not identity

### 7. Mechanism individuation (next bottleneck)
- Mechanism kinds also cluster-ish, with family resemblances
- Recursion is depth, not bug

### 8. Re-interpretation of theoretical disagreements
- Many disputes = disagreements about which mechanism does work, not which definition is correct

---

## Part E: Khalidi Alignment

### Key Agreements
- Projectibility as core diagnostic for real kinds
- Rejection of definitional essences
- Stress tests reveal real causal nexus vs historically sticky label

### Khalidi-Flavoured Revisions to Consider
- Replace some "mechanism" talk with **"ordered causal hierarchy of properties"** for maximum metaphysical bite
- Build bridge to social-kinds framework when discussing grammar as coordination-sensitive system

### Main Value-Add from Khalidi
Sharper rule for when "non-projective" means:
- **"Needs better mechanism"** vs
- **"Isn't the right kind at all"**

---

## Part F: The Ten Aphorisms

1. A grammatical category is not a thing you find; it's a regime you maintain.
2. The ontology of grammar is closer to ecology than taxonomy.
3. Category boundaries are often the visible face of stabilising dynamics.
4. A kind's reality is indexed to the bets it makes safe.
5. "Same category" across languages is a claim about convergent maintenance, not shared essence.
6. Mechanisms are not beneath categories; they are partially sculpted by them.
7. Arguments over definitions are, at bottom, arguments over stabilisers.
8. A label that doesn't project is not false; it's mechanistically underspecified.
9. Discreteness is not a starting point; it's an emergent achievement.
10. The most telling facts about categories live in their failure modes.

---

## Part G: Drop-In Manifesto

### Version 1: Aphorism-threaded (more poetic)

A grammatical category is not a thing you find; it's a regime you maintain. The ontology of grammar is closer to ecology than taxonomy—boundaries are often the visible face of stabilising dynamics, not arbitrary lines drawn on a continuous space. A kind's reality is indexed to the bets it makes safe: when a category supports reliable induction, something in the world is doing that work. Across languages, "same category" is a claim about convergent maintenance, not shared essence. Mechanisms are not hidden beneath categories; they are partially sculpted by them—a reciprocal loop where learning shapes usage shapes learning. Arguments over definitions are, at bottom, arguments over stabilisers. A label that doesn't project is not false; it's mechanistically underspecified. Discreteness is not a starting point; it's an emergent achievement. And the most telling facts about categories live in their failure modes—where boundaries blur, where judgments diverge, where the stabilising dynamics show their seams.

### Version 2: Expository (more chapter-opener appropriate)

A grammatical category is less a thing you discover than a regime you help explain: a maintained pattern of co-instantiating properties that earns its keep by making certain generalisations a good bet. On this view, the ontology of grammar is closer to ecology than to taxonomy. Boundaries are often stabilising dynamics made legible—analogy, entrenchment, acquisition biases, processing pressures, diachronic channeling—rather than the outward face of hidden definitions. And the relationship is reciprocal: mechanisms are not hidden beneath categories waiting to be discovered; they are partially sculpted by the very clusters they sustain. Discreteness is not a starting point; it is an emergent achievement: sharpness can emerge at particular scales even when the underlying causal story is plural and the membership conditions remain graded. Crosslinguistic sameness, then, is not a claim that languages share an essence called noun or adjective, but that different systems converge on similar maintenance packages that support similar projections. The deeper methodological payoff is that failure modes become diagnostic. When a label does not project, the right inference is not automatically that the label is wrong, but that its causal scaffolding is underspecified, mislocated, or heterogeneous—precisely the error pattern that can reveal whether yesterday's definitional dispute is really a disagreement about stabilisers.

---

## Part H: Next Frontier Theses

- Grammar is a **population-level causal regime** more than an inventory of mental objects.
- The reality of grammatical kinds is **proportional to their intervention- and prediction-value**.
- Crosslinguistic category sameness is **convergence of stabilising functions**, not identity of defining features.
- Mechanisms and categories form a **two-level homeostatic loop**: categories shape learning/usage which shapes categories.

The last = **reciprocal realism**: mechanisms aren't just beneath categories — they're partly co-constructed by the category systems they stabilise.

---

## Part I: Evidence to Include

- Acquisition overgeneralization (Bloom 1994, Barner 2005, Gordon 1985)
- Diachronic cases (pease→pea, data/datum shift)
- Cross-linguistic patterns (Welsh singulatives, classifier languages)
- Processing predictions (priming asymmetries, graded violation costs)
- Corpus frequency patterns (tight vs. loose property distributions)

---

## Part J: Structural Recommendations

### Primary Structure: By Timescale
(More empirically grounded)

### Secondary Dimension: Internal/External

### Key Theoretical Claims to Develop
1. **Mechanism stacking**: body, cognition, and society always co-stabilize
2. **Bidirectional coupling**: form-meaning inference operates in both directions
3. **Multi-level stabilisation**: different mechanisms at different timescales interact
4. **Functional ecology**: alternatives in the system affect pressure
5. **Neither deterministic nor random**: mechanisms bias toward coherence but don't guarantee it

---

## Part K: Forward References

- **Chapter 14 (ABM)**: How the mechanisms interact—whether alignment can override entrenchment, whether transmission bottlenecks can shift basin boundaries—is an empirical question. ABM offers one route.

---

## Part L: Open Questions

1. How to balance technical precision with accessibility?
2. Present formal models (iterated learning) or stay conceptual?
3. How much cross-linguistic evidence is enough?
4. Should processing predictions be presented as tested or testable?
5. How to avoid the chapter becoming a literature review?

## Part O: Packaging Board Feedback (2025-12-07)

### Shared Diagnosis
The intellectual payload is right; the worry is *where the reader breathes* and *when abstract claims get a tactile handle*. Risk: reading like an internal map that forgets the outside world.

### Board-Approved Action List

1. **Open with mystery, not framework**
   Start with one short "label fails to project" moment, then let reader feel the need for mechanisms.

2. **Use Version 2 as backbone, add sceptic-friendly line**
   Booth + McCloskey: acknowledge reader's doubt explicitly before cashing it out.
   - Suggested addition after first two sentences: *"If that sounds like a metaphysical upgrade too far, good: the argument earns it by showing how the stabilisers do predictive work that definitions couldn't."*

3. **Reduce mechanism-ontology menu to three stepping stones**
   Too many framings early feels like literature map rather than narrative.
   - Combine "real patterns" + "mechanisms as HPC kinds"
   - Keep "multi-mechanism realism" prominent
   - Make "model-first humility" a short end-cap

4. **One crisp example per timescale**
   Timescale organisation is strong — ensure each level has a vivid anchor.

5. **Make "normative naturalism" concrete and symmetrical**
   Show case where norms sharpen AND another where they mislead.

6. **Single clean figure**
   Tufte-Holmes compromise: minimal schematic + one playful metaphor if desired.

### Structural Recommendations

**Mendelson's narrative arc:**
1. A crisp *failure* (category that doesn't project)
2. The tempting definitional fix (briefly, then reject)
3. The mechanism lens that actually explains the failure
4. Only then: full mechanism ontology + inventory

**McPhee's scaffolding:**
- 2–3 paragraph micro-case at the top
- "Zoom lens" move into general framework

**Godin's one-line promise:**
> *"Why grammar categories persist even when nobody can define them — and how that makes them trustworthy tools rather than academic habits."*

**Sutherland's reframe:**
Not "we've been wrong about categories," but "we finally have a way to explain why the categories that *work* keep working."

### Figural Spine (Fahnestock)

Pick **one controlling figure per section**:
- Opening = *ecology/maintenance regimes*
- Mechanism ontology = *real patterns / causal braids*
- Timescales = *nested loops*
- Failure modes = *stress-testing a bridge*

### Hybrid Opener Shape

1. **Cold open:** short failure case
2. **Two-sentence teaser:** "definitions won't help; stabilisers will"
3. **Version 2 paragraph (lightly tightened)**
4. **Promise:** "We'll sort mechanisms by timescale and by internal/external location, then cash out what that commits us to metaphysically."

### Voice Notes

- **Booth:** Make implied reader feel *competent*, not instructed
- **McCloskey:** Treat normativity as empirical social fact with costs, not philosophical trophy
- **Pinker:** "This is not 'definitions are useless.' It's 'definitions don't explain the *stability* of the generalisations we rely on.'"
- **Becker:** Show how framework lets you *read existing work more charitably*
- **Morris:** Let essentialist sound reasonable right before showing explanatory shortfall
- **Latour:** Show essentialism embedded in textbook templates, annotation schemes, software constraints, educational assessment

### Excerptability (Holiday)

Identify 600–900 word excerptable passage. Version 1 (aphorism-threaded) or polished hybrid of 1 and 2.


### Version 3: Board-Integrated Opener (Final)

Chapter 7 takes up the question that Chapter 6 deliberately left hanging: if categories earn their keep by supporting induction, what exactly is doing the keeping? If talk of mechanisms sounds like a metaphysical upgrade too far, good — the argument has to earn that upgrade by showing explanatory and predictive traction that definitional tidy-up can't deliver. The point is not that definitions are useless; they are often excellent summaries of what we already know. The point is that definitions don't explain stability. They don't tell us why a cluster of properties keeps reappearing across speakers, contexts, and generations, nor why certain generalisations remain a good bet even when boundary cases proliferate. The homeostatic picture shifts attention from classificatory checklists to maintenance regimes: the interacting feedback loops — acquisition and entrenchment, analogy and alignment, discourse-functional pressures and institutional norms — that make particular patterns resilient, transmissible, and epistemically useful. When a label projects, it's because these stabilisers keep the relevant similarities in circulation; when it doesn't, that failure is not a nuisance to be patched with a cleverer definition but a clue to where the maintenance regime is thin, conflicted, or absent.


---

## Part P: Opening and Closing Options

### Key Insight
**Don't start with the question. Start with a fact that makes the question unavoidable.**

---

### Opening Options

**Option A: The backformation opening (pease/pea)**

> In Old English, *pease* was a mass noun, like *rice*. You could have much pease or little pease, but not three peases. Sometime in the seventeenth century, English speakers began treating *pease* as a plural—and invented a singular to match. *Pea* never existed until the category demanded it. The word is a fossil of a mechanism: speakers maintaining a count/mass distinction by backforming what the paradigm seemed to require.

Pivot: "This is what it looks like when a grammatical category repairs itself. But what exactly is doing the repair?"

**Option B: The competing-pressures opening (foots/feet)**

> A child says *foots*. Every adult in earshot knows it's wrong. Within a year, the child says *feet*. No one taught the rule; no one corrected explicitly. Something in the input, something in the child's processing, something in the community's gentle non-uptake of *foots*—some combination of pressures converged on the irregular form and held it there. What held it?

Pivot: "That question—*what holds it*—is the one essentialism never asks. Definitions tell you what a category *is*. They don't tell you why it stays that way."

**Option C: The diachronic-puzzle opening (will grammaticalisation)**

> *Will* was a lexical verb meaning "to want." It still is, vestigially, in *willy-nilly* ("will he, nill he") and archaic *what you will*. But over six centuries, it grammaticalised into an auxiliary, acquiring new syntax (subject-auxiliary inversion, *n't* cliticisation) while shedding old semantics (volition faded to futurity). The puzzle isn't that it changed—everything changes. The puzzle is that it *stopped* changing: it reached auxiliary status and stabilized there. What stopped it?

Pivot: "The answer isn't a definition. The answer is a bundle of mechanisms—processing pressures, frequency effects, paradigmatic slots, acquisitional biases—that converged on a stable configuration and held."

---

### Closing Options

**Option A: The aphorism landing**

> Discreteness is not a starting point; it's an emergent achievement. The grammatical categories we name and teach and parse are not the furniture of language waiting to be discovered. They are regimes—dynamic, maintained, susceptible to drift and repair. When we ask "what is a noun?" we are not asking for a definition. We are asking what keeps noun-ness coherent across speakers, generations, and contexts. The answer is not a single thing. It is a conspiracy of mechanisms, each partial, together sufficient. The next question is whether we can watch them interact—and whether, in watching, we can predict where the categories will go.

**Option B: The metaphor payoff (coral reef)**

> A coral reef is not a thing; it is a process slow enough to look like a thing. Polyps deposit calcium carbonate; currents distribute larvae; fish establish cleaning stations; the whole assembles into something that persists for millennia—until it doesn't. Grammatical categories are like this. They feel solid because the mechanisms that maintain them are invisible at the timescale of a conversation, a lesson, a paper. Zoom out, and you see the deposition, the distribution, the slow crystallisation of community standards. Zoom further, and you see the bleaching events: categories that drifted, merged, split, disappeared. What looks like an ontology is an ecology. What looks like a definition is a maintenance contract, perpetually renegotiated.

**Option C: The challenge close**

> The framework offered here makes predictions. If grammatical categories are HPC kinds maintained by identifiable mechanisms, then perturbing those mechanisms should shift the category boundaries in predictable ways. Disrupt acquisition input, and overgeneralisation patterns should change. Alter frequency distributions, and entrenchment should weaken. Isolate speakers from community norms, and alignment should drift. These are not metaphors. They are interventions. The next chapter asks whether we can model them—and the chapters after ask what we find when we look.

---

### Recommended Architecture

1. **Open** with pease/pea or foots/feet—short, vivid, mechanism caught in action
2. **First section**: "What kind of thing is a mechanism?" (compressed)
3. **Core sections**: The five mechanisms, organised by timescale, each with concrete case
4. **Penultimate section**: Hidden commitments, reframed as "what you're now committed to"
5. **Close** with ecological-metaphor or challenge close, depending on audience

---

### Template Summaries

**Opener template:**
- Micro-case failure
- Definitional "temptation"
- One-sentence rejection framed as stability problem
- Version 3 paragraph
- Roadmap

**Closer template:**
- Revisit the same micro-case
- Three-claim compression
- Failure-as-diagnostic sting
- Bridge to next chapter


---

## Part Q: Refined Opening/Closing Recommendations

### Opening Dos and Don'ts

**Don't open with:** Aphorisms, mechanism inventory, timescale taxonomy (conclusions/architecture, not invitations)

**Do open with:** The question Chapter 6 leaves hanging

**Option A: Return to the standing wave** (from Chapter 4)
> A standing wave isn't a thing moving through water—it's a pattern held in place by flow. The flow is real; the wave is what the flow makes legible. We've been talking about grammatical categories as if they were standing waves: stable patterns without fixed substance. But we haven't yet said what the flow is.

Then: one mechanism in concrete detail (cattle, pease→pea). Then zoom out.

**Option B: A witness** (Morris's advice)
Open with Divjak discovering the 77% figure, or Bybee noticing high-frequency irregulars resist analogy—a specific moment when someone realized definitions weren't doing the work. Then generalize.

---

### Closing Structure

**Don't close with:** Mechanism inventory, Khalidi alignment, open questions (middle-chapter material)

**Do close with:** Reciprocal realism + aphorisms as earned conclusions + bridge to failure modes

**Structure:**

1. **The reciprocal move** (chapter's payoff):
> Mechanisms aren't hidden beneath categories waiting to be discovered. They're partially sculpted by the very clusters they sustain. Learning shapes usage shapes learning. The maintenance is bidirectional.

2. **The subsumption framing** (Becker—redemption, not replacement):
> The definitional work wasn't wasted. It was the empirical base on which mechanistic explanation becomes possible. Definitions clustered the phenomena well enough that we can now ask: what maintains the clustering? The essentialists weren't wrong. They were preparatory.

3. **Select aphorisms as earned conclusions:**
- A grammatical category is not a thing you find; it's a regime you maintain.
- Arguments over definitions are, at bottom, arguments over stabilisers.
- The most telling facts about categories live in their failure modes.

4. **Bridge to Chapter 8:**
> But if categories are maintained, they can be undermaintained. The mechanisms can fail to cluster, or cluster too loosely, or cluster in ways that don't project. The next chapter asks: how do we know when we don't have a kind?

---

### Summary Table

| | Opening | Closing |
|---|---|---|
| **Lead with** | Standing-wave metaphor, or witness moment | Reciprocal realism as thesis |
| **Then** | One mechanism in concrete detail | Subsumption framing (preparatory, not wrong) |
| **Avoid** | Inventory, taxonomy, aphorisms-as-premises | Open questions, Khalidi technicalities |
| **Tone** | Invitation: "here's what the flow is" | Earned conclusion: "here's what we now see" |
| **Bridge** | From Ch 6's "what maintains the island?" | To Ch 8's "how do we know when maintenance fails?" |


---

## Part R: Adam Smith Connection

### Agreements with Smith

1. **Categories emerge from use, not definitions from above**
   Smith's *Considerations Concerning the First Formation of Languages* (1761) argues grammatical categories arose through speakers' practical need, generalised through analogy and frequency. Mechanism-talk avant la lettre.

2. **The "man of system" warning applies to essentialist linguists**
   "Every single piece has a principle of motion of its own." Speakers are agents shaped by, but not determined by, the system they inherit.

3. **Simplification and complexification are trade-offs, not progress**
   Mechanisms don't optimise for any single value—they produce coherence at some scales while sacrificing it at others.

### Productive Friction

1. **Where's the self-interest?**
   What do individual speakers *gain* from maintaining a category boundary? Answer: they don't "bother"—they just do what's easy, and ease is shaped by frequency and processing costs. Make this explicit.

2. **Is "mechanism" a reification?**
   "Mechanisms stabilise the cluster" — who or what is doing the stabilising? If it's just speakers speaking, say so.

---

### Recommended Epigraph

> "The general rule would establish itself insensibly, and by slow degrees, in consequence of that love of analogy and similarity of sound, which is the foundation of by far the greater part of the rules of grammar."
> —Adam Smith, *Considerations Concerning the First Formation of Languages* (1761)

Names the mechanism (analogy, phonological similarity), the timescale (insensibly, by slow degrees), the locus (the rule establishes *itself*—no legislator).

### Alternative Epigraph (political resonance)

> "He does not consider that the pieces upon the chess-board have no other principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own."
> —Adam Smith, *Theory of Moral Sentiments* (VI.ii.2.17)

### For the Body

**On emergence without design:**
> "It is this application of the name of an individual to a great multitude of objects, whose resemblance naturally recalls the idea of that individual, and of the name which expresses it, that seems originally to have given occasion to the formation of those classes and assortments, which, in the schools, are called *genera* and *species*."

**Ferguson (for Scottish Enlightenment tradition explicitly):**
> "Nations stumble upon establishments, which are indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design."
> —Adam Ferguson, *Essay on the History of Civil Society* (1767)
