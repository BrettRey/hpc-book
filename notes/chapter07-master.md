## Part A: What the Chapter Must Do

### From Previous Chapters

Chapter 6 ends with:
> "The label names the island, not the volcano. But we've talked about mechanisms as if they were self-explanatory. They aren't. What exactly maintains the island? What processes stabilise the clustering, ensure that new instances resemble old ones, transmit the pattern across speakers and generations? The next chapter opens the black box."

Chapter 6 introduces but doesn't develop:
- **Entrenchment** (Polish aspect: 90% of verbs prefer one form)
- **Tense-conditioning** (F1 0.95/0.90 for aspect prediction from tense)
- **Terrain/constraint-landscape language** (Chater-compliant)
- **Bidirectionality** (aspect→verb and verb→aspect both active)

### Core Question
What exactly are the mechanisms, and what kind of thing is a mechanism?

---

## Part B: What Kind of Thing Is a Mechanism?

### Five Compatible Framings

1. **Mechanisms as organised causal processes**
   - Most common philosophy-of-science view: organised set of parts/activities producing a phenomenon
   - Level-dependent: neural circuit, biochemical cascade, social pipeline, learning dynamic
   - HPC leans on this: mechanisms are whatever organised causal structure keeps the cluster co-instantiating

2. **Mechanisms as "real patterns" rather than essences**
   - Realist without making them micro-essences
   - A mechanism = stable pattern of causal organisation supporting counterfactuals and interventions

3. **Mechanisms can themselves be HPC kinds** (recursive option)
   - Mechanism types (entrenchment, alignment, etc.) need not have strict N&S definitions
   - Could be cluster of causal features tending to recur across contexts
   - No sharp boundary required for explanatory or real status

4. **Multi-mechanism realism**
   - Naturally pluralist: category maintained by several overlapping mechanisms, none individually necessary
   - "What kind of thing is the mechanism?" → contributory causal strand in braided stabilising story

5. **Model-first humility**
   - Mechanisms partly discovered, partly modelled
   - Commit to *something* in causal structure doing stabilising, even if taxonomy is rough

### One-liner
> Mechanisms are the stabilising causal patterns we are warranted in positing because they make the clustering and its projectibility non-accidental.

## Part C: The Mechanism Inventory

### Primary Framework: By Timescale

**Fastest (milliseconds): Processing**
- Bidirectional inference (comprehension ↔ production)
- Priming effects
- Processing costs for violations

**Intermediate (years): Acquisition and Entrenchment**
- Schema extension (learners generalize from partial patterns)
- Frequency-based entrenchment (Bybee 2010)
- Paradigmatic pressure (regularisation toward dominant patterns)

**Slowest (decades): Institutional Norms**
- Editorial practice, style guides
- Schooling and standardisation
- Orthographic conventions

### Secondary Dimension: Internal/External (Miller 2021)

**Internal (individual) mechanisms:**
- Mental lexicon retrieval
- Recognition/interpretation
- Derivation consistency

**External (social) mechanisms:**
- Performance standards (Tolerance Principle)
- Community norms
- Register-specific standards

**Critical insight:** Neither internal nor external alone is sufficient — both required together.

### The Five Core Mechanisms (from Ch 1/5 preview)

1. **Acquisition** — how clusters are learned from input
2. **Entrenchment** — how frequency deepens attractors
3. **Alignment** — how speakers coordinate in interaction (Pickering & Garrod)
4. **Transmission** — how patterns propagate across generations (Kirby)
5. **Functional pressure** — which distinctions are communicatively useful

**Interaction:** "The fast loop generates usage patterns; the slow loop crystallises them into community standards"

### Level-Specific Mechanisms

**Phonemes:**
- Quantal stability (articulatory "sweet spots")
- Dispersion pressure
- Perceptual magnets

**Words:**
- Orthographic standardisation
- Editorial norms
- Register/genre licensing

**Constructions:**
- Cue redundancy
- Normative pressure

## Part D: Hidden Commitments

### 1. Process ontology
Category ≠ static object. Category = dynamically sustained attractor in population-level causal field.

### 2. Interventionist realism
> A kind is real to the extent that manipulating (or tracking) it reliably changes expectations about downstream properties.
- Real kinds = control-relevant partitions, not just descriptive clusters

### 3. Normatively-inflected naturalism
- Competence norms are emergent ecological facts
- Way to talk about grammaticality without essences AND without collapsing into taste

### 4. Measurable metaphysics
- Kindhood as gradient and quantifiable via projectibility metrics
- Operational teeth: entropy reduction, cross-context generalisation accuracy, inter-speaker agreement

### 5. Social ontology of grammar
- Grammatical kinds = partially social kinds (stabilised by coordination equilibria)
- Standard varieties produce sharper category effects; stigma/prestige act like selection pressures

### 6. Plural groundings of "the same" category
- "Noun" as convergent kind: real but multiply realised across typological space
- Crosslinguistic sameness = functional-mechanistic overlap, not identity

### 7. Mechanism individuation (next bottleneck)
- Mechanism kinds also cluster-ish, with family resemblances
- Recursion is depth, not bug

### 8. Re-interpretation of theoretical disagreements
- Many disputes = disagreements about which mechanism does work, not which definition is correct

---

## Part E: Khalidi Alignment

### Key Agreements
- Projectibility as core diagnostic for real kinds
- Rejection of definitional essences
- Stress tests reveal real causal nexus vs historically sticky label

### Khalidi-Flavoured Revisions to Consider
- Replace some "mechanism" talk with **"ordered causal hierarchy of properties"** for maximum metaphysical bite
- Build bridge to social-kinds framework when discussing grammar as coordination-sensitive system

### Main Value-Add from Khalidi
Sharper rule for when "non-projective" means:
- **"Needs better mechanism"** vs
- **"Isn't the right kind at all"**

## Part F: The Ten Aphorisms

1. A grammatical category is not a thing you find; it's a regime you maintain.
2. The ontology of grammar is closer to ecology than taxonomy.
3. Category boundaries are often the visible face of stabilising dynamics.
4. A kind's reality is indexed to the bets it makes safe.
5. "Same category" across languages is a claim about convergent maintenance, not shared essence.
6. Mechanisms are not beneath categories; they are partially sculpted by them.
7. Arguments over definitions are, at bottom, arguments over stabilisers.
8. A label that doesn't project is not false; it's mechanistically underspecified.
9. Discreteness is not a starting point; it's an emergent achievement.
10. The most telling facts about categories live in their failure modes.

---

## Part G: Drop-In Manifesto

### Version 1: Aphorism-threaded (more poetic)

A grammatical category is not a thing you find; it's a regime you maintain. The ontology of grammar is closer to ecology than taxonomy—boundaries are often the visible face of stabilising dynamics, not arbitrary lines drawn on a continuous space. A kind's reality is indexed to the bets it makes safe: when a category supports reliable induction, something in the world is doing that work. Across languages, "same category" is a claim about convergent maintenance, not shared essence. Mechanisms are not hidden beneath categories; they are partially sculpted by them—a reciprocal loop where learning shapes usage shapes learning. Arguments over definitions are, at bottom, arguments over stabilisers. A label that doesn't project is not false; it's mechanistically underspecified. Discreteness is not a starting point; it's an emergent achievement. And the most telling facts about categories live in their failure modes—where boundaries blur, where judgments diverge, where the stabilising dynamics show their seams.

### Version 2: Expository (more chapter-opener appropriate)

A grammatical category is less a thing you discover than a regime you help explain: a maintained pattern of co-instantiating properties that earns its keep by making certain generalisations a good bet. On this view, the ontology of grammar is closer to ecology than to taxonomy. Boundaries are often stabilising dynamics made legible—analogy, entrenchment, acquisition biases, processing pressures, diachronic channeling—rather than the outward face of hidden definitions. And the relationship is reciprocal: mechanisms are not hidden beneath categories waiting to be discovered; they are partially sculpted by the very clusters they sustain. Discreteness is not a starting point; it is an emergent achievement: sharpness can emerge at particular scales even when the underlying causal story is plural and the membership conditions remain graded. Crosslinguistic sameness, then, is not a claim that languages share an essence called noun or adjective, but that different systems converge on similar maintenance packages that support similar projections. The deeper methodological payoff is that failure modes become diagnostic. When a label does not project, the right inference is not automatically that the label is wrong, but that its causal scaffolding is underspecified, mislocated, or heterogeneous—precisely the error pattern that can reveal whether yesterday's definitional dispute is really a disagreement about stabilisers.

## Part H: Next Frontier Theses

- Grammar is a **population-level causal regime** more than an inventory of mental objects.
- The reality of grammatical kinds is **proportional to their intervention- and prediction-value**.
- Crosslinguistic category sameness is **convergence of stabilising functions**, not identity of defining features.
- Mechanisms and categories form a **two-level homeostatic loop**: categories shape learning/usage which shapes categories.

The last = **reciprocal realism**: mechanisms aren't just beneath categories — they're partly co-constructed by the category systems they stabilise.

---

## Part I: Evidence to Include

- Acquisition overgeneralization (Bloom 1994, Barner 2005, Gordon 1985)
- Diachronic cases (pease→pea, data/datum shift)
- Cross-linguistic patterns (Welsh singulatives, classifier languages)
- Processing predictions (priming asymmetries, graded violation costs)
- Corpus frequency patterns (tight vs. loose property distributions)

---

## Part J: Structural Recommendations

### Primary Structure: By Timescale
(More empirically grounded)

### Secondary Dimension: Internal/External

### Key Theoretical Claims to Develop
1. **Mechanism stacking**: body, cognition, and society always co-stabilize
2. **Bidirectional coupling**: form-meaning inference operates in both directions
3. **Multi-level stabilisation**: different mechanisms at different timescales interact
4. **Functional ecology**: alternatives in the system affect pressure
5. **Neither deterministic nor random**: mechanisms bias toward coherence but don't guarantee it

---

## Part K: Forward References

- **Chapter 14 (ABM)**: How the mechanisms interact—whether alignment can override entrenchment, whether transmission bottlenecks can shift basin boundaries—is an empirical question. ABM offers one route.

---

## Part L: Open Questions

1. How to balance technical precision with accessibility?
2. Present formal models (iterated learning) or stay conceptual?
3. How much cross-linguistic evidence is enough?
4. Should processing predictions be presented as tested or testable?
5. How to avoid the chapter becoming a literature review?
