## What This Session Developed

This session developed **field-relative projectibility** — a core theoretical principle for the HPC book that had been implicit but not articulated. The principle: projectibility is indexed to analytical purpose. What supports reliable induction for a semanticist may not for a syntactician.

## The Journey (For Book History)

1. **Starting point:** User asked about a note on "projectability being field relevant" from the English-Constructionary schema
2. **Found the idea** in `data/schemas/construction.json` line 26 — the `type` field specifying which domain provides "maximal projectability"
3. **Developed the example:** Proper noun (syntactic) vs. proper name (semantic) — same extension, different projectibility
4. **Pedagogical hook:** "Syntax 101 teaches the epistemology (diagnostics); this book provides the ontology (why the categories differ)"
5. **Connected to deitality paper:** Same structure — definiteness (semantic) vs. deitality (structural)
6. **Connected to countability (Ch 9):** Same structure — semantic individuation vs. morphosyntactic count-marking
7. **Discovered this touches every chapter:** Part I (reframes essentialist/nominalist debate), Part II (refines projectibility, stabilisers, failure modes), Part III (case studies all demonstrate the pattern), Part IV (CxG connection, methodology)
8. **Side trip to HPC slogans:** Tabarok's "price = signal + incentive" — explored why this imports market assumptions that don't fit linguistic HPCs
9. **The three-way discipline:** Don't collapse metaphysics (mechanisms) / epistemology (projectibility) / pragmatics (what classification is for)

## The Methodology (For Writing With LLMs)

### What Worked

1. **The author pushed back repeatedly** — "you're awfully incurious," "SLOW DOWN," "you're just jumping to implementation"
2. **Asking "is there more?"** — Each time the LLM thought it was done, pushing deeper revealed new connections
3. **Demanding intellectual engagement before notes** — The substance had to be developed conversationally before being transcribed
4. **Testing slogans for hidden assumptions** — The Tabarok exercise showed how compact formulas can smuggle in inappropriate frameworks

### Lessons for LLM-Assisted Theoretical Work

1. **Resist the pull to resolution.** LLMs (possibly due to RL training) want to reach outcomes. Push back.
2. **Keep asking "and so?"** — Force the implications out.
3. **Don't let the LLM transcribe prematurely.** Implementation mode kills thinking.
4. **Use the LLM to explore scope.** Once a principle is articulated, ask it to trace connections through the whole book.
5. **Correct gently but firmly.** The LLM lost track of the argument several times; the author redirected without abandoning the thread.

### The Anti-Pattern to Avoid

The LLM's default mode:
> User says X → LLM says "interesting!" → LLM creates note → LLM asks "what's next?"

This kills intellectual development. Better:
> User says X → LLM probes X → User refines → LLM finds implications → User pushes for more → ... → Eventually, create notes

## Artifacts Created

1. **`notes/field-relative-projectibility.md`** — Comprehensive theoretical note
2. **Addition to `CLAUDE.md`** — "Intellectual Engagement" section with methodology guidance
3. **This session log** — `notes/session-2025-12-24-field-relative-projectibility.md`

## Open Questions (For Future Work)

1. Does the Ch 6 outline need revision to introduce field-relativity explicitly?
2. Should Ch 8's "Two-Diagnostic Test" become three (add cluster robustness check)?
3. How does this connect to acquisition — do children acquire semantic and syntactic clusters separately?
4. Are there categories that genuinely DON'T decompose this way?
