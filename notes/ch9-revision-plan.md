# Chapter 9 Advisory Board Synthesis

**Date:** 2025-12-16  
**Reviewers:** Becker, Rosch, Goldberg (Codex); Millikan, Tomasello, Zimmer (Gemini)

## Context Filter

These reviews were done *in isolation*. Many criticisms (e.g., "explain HPC vs. prototype theory," "acknowledge construction grammar") may already be addressed in earlier chapters. The actionable items below are filtered for **genuinely chapter-level issues**.

---

## ACTIONABLE REVISIONS

### 1. Tone/Rhetoric (Becker)

**Specific targets:**
- Line 89: "proves that countability is an autonomous grammatical system" → soften to "suggests" or "makes it hard to maintain that..."
- Line 122: "The error proves the mechanism works" → rephrase
- Lines 342-343: "No version of feature-bundle theory... No version of prototype theory..." → grant each a job first, then say what's missing
- Line 346: "The wrong question" → try "less fruitful question" or "it hides the structure"

**Principle:** Swap courtroom language for collaborative language. Don't grade the reader.

---

### 2. Section 12 "Lab Report Mode" (Zimmer)

**Problem:** "ablation by perturbation," "disconfirmation condition," "reallocation" feel like grant-proposal language.

**Fix:** 
- Replace headers like "Perturbation 1: The collective basin" with something like "What happens when you remove the default?"
- Frame cross-linguistic evidence as "what-ifs" rather than clinical trials

---

### 3. Slow Down Individuation Section (Zimmer, Rosch)

**Problem:** Boundedness, atomicity, enumerability, homogeneity-resistance pile up quickly.

**Fix:**
- Add one sentence per property linking it to an empirical handle (task, developmental milestone, dissociation)
- Explicitly distinguish **perceptual individuation** (segmentation, tracking) from **linguistic/conceptual individuation** (construal, conventional packaging) — this prevents "ontology → grammar" misreadings

---

### 4. Bridge Macrophage/Echolocation Back to Linguistics (Zimmer, Rosch)

**Problem:** These analogies are "brilliant" but risk feeling like rhetorical flourish.

**Fix:** Explicitly state that the brain recycles edge-detection software across vision, immunity, and grammar. Make the bridge load-bearing, not decorative.

---

### 5. Developmental Pathway (Tomasello)

**Problem:** The acquisition section compresses years into a moment. Children are **item-based** first (Islands of Reliability), then generalize.

**Fixes:**
- [ ] Add: "Children don't arrive at the count cluster all at once. Early productions are item-specific..."
- [ ] Introduce **type frequency** as the statistical engine driving abstraction (high token → entrenchment; high type → slot generalization)
- [ ] Ground "functional anchoring" in **joint attention** — we single out individuals because communication requires identifying topics

---

### 6. Alternative Metaphor: Clownfish/Anemone (Zimmer)

**Current:** "Lock and key" with tolerances — implies static mechanical fit.

**Suggested:** Clownfish/anemone symbiosis — the word gets stability from the grammar; grammar gets "fed" by word use. If separated, both struggle. *Data* is a clownfish searching for a new host because *datum* died.

**Action:** Consider adding this alongside or instead of locks. More dynamic, fits "homeostatic maintenance" better.

---

### 7. Explicit Implicational-Hierarchy Payoff (Goldberg, Rosch)

**Problem:** The "tight-before-loose" hierarchy is the most original claim, but it gets buried.

**Fix:**
- Make the hierarchy prediction **explicit and prominent** — this is what distinguishes HPC from prototype theory and construction grammar
- State clearly: "Prototype theory predicts gradedness; HPC predicts *this particular shape* of gradedness."

---

## DO NOT REVISE (Already Addressed in Book)

These criticisms apply to a standalone paper, not Ch 9 in context:

- "Add Relation to Prototype Theory section" (Rosch) — Ch 2 and Ch 4 already establish this
- "Distinguish HPC from construction grammar" (Goldberg) — Part II establishes HPC as meta-framework
- "Definitions of HPC, homeostasis, mechanism" (various) — Ch 4-7 define these
