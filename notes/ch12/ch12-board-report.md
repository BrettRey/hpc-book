# Chapter 12 Board Report: Gender and the Maintenance Spectrum

**Generated**: 2025-12-26
**Status**: Full advisory board review complete

---

## Synthesis of Key Insights

### Unanimous Consensus
- **The maintenance spectrum is typologically sound** (Corbett, Croft, Kirby)
- **English and French gender are ontologically distinct kinds** (Boyd, Khalidi, Millikan)
- **Reynolds's pro-form extension is the strongest empirical contribution** (Corbett, Goldberg)
- **The chapter is essential for the book's architecture** (all 14 members)

### Core Reframings

| Aspect | English | French |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Mechanism | Semantic congruence | Morphological entrenchment |
| Causal arrow | World/Concept → Word | Word → Word |
| Millikan's term | World-tracking | Token-tracking |
| Bybee's term | Type frequency (schemas) | Token frequency (chunks) |
| Kirby's term | Compressed (rule-based) | Uncompressed (memory-based) |
| Chater's term | Simulation | Memory lookup |
| Fedorenko's locus | ToM network + Language | Language Network only |

### Key Metaphors (Zimmer)
- **Ship vs. Table**: Hook the reader with the *feeling* before the theory
- **Tuning Fork vs. ID Card**: English "tunes" to the world; French checks the bureaucracy
- **Singular *they***: Not disruption but *perfection* of the English system

### Critical Refinements

1. **Millikan**: Don't say French gender is "dead" — it's *exapted* (function shifted from external correspondence to internal coherence)

2. **Croft**: Frame "Gender" as a *comparative concept* covering distinct *descriptive categories*

3. **Bybee**: Transparency and entrenchment are *inversely compensatory* — high entrenchment supports opacity; low entrenchment forces semantic transparency

4. **Tomasello**: Acquisition bifurcation — English is *intent reading*; French is *pattern finding*

5. **Fedorenko**: Neural prediction — English gender violations should activate ToM network; French violations should hit Language Network

6. **Kirby**: Compressibility spectrum — English traded entrenchment for inference

### Empirical Predictions to Include

| Prediction | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| Agreement Hierarchy | English shows no hierarchy effects; German does |
| Acquisition | English errors = conceptual; French errors = memory |
| Neologisms | English assigns on-the-fly; French needs formal rule |
| Aphasia | English gender may survive global aphasia (ToM intact) |

## Recommended Chapter Structure (updated)

### §1 Hook: The Ship and the Table (~400 words)
- Open with *feeling*, not chart
- Ship as *she* = live semantic choice
- Table as *la* = bureaucratic tag
- Promise: what maintains these systems differs

### §2 English: The Tuning Fork (~800 words)
- Designatum-driven / World-tracking
- Reynolds's hierarchy: Personal > (Epicene | Sexual); Non-personal > (Locative | Temporal)
- Pro-form extension (who/which, where/when)
- Metonymy success: French fries → *she*

### §3 French: The ID Card (~600 words)
- Antecedent-driven / Token-tracking
- Millikan: exapted function (discourse cohesion, not world-mapping)
- Bybee: syntagmatic chunks (la-table)
- Metonymy failure: cannot jump to waiter

### §4 German: The Conflict Zone (~500 words)
- *Das Mädchen... sie*
- Two mechanisms fighting for same channel
- Agreement Hierarchy effects

### §5 The Maintenance Spectrum (~600 words)
- Compressibility axis (Kirby)
- Acquisition bifurcation (Tomasello)
- Neural dissociation prediction (Fedorenko)

### §6 Implications (~400 words)
- Field-relative projectibility
- Singular *they* as perfection, not disruption
- Croft: comparative concept vs descriptive category

### §7 Summary (~300 words)
- Same label, different ontology
- The spectrum maps storage vs computation
