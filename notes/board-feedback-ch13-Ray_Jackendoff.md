A commendable effort to impose some order on the chaos. The intuition that the relationship between form and meaning is not uniform across all linguistic phenomena is, of course, correct. However, the proposed "coupling gradient" along a *single stack* is a significant architectural misstep. It conflates the inventory of stored "pieces of language" with the combinatorial systems that use them. The real picture is not a single ladder with different kinds of rungs, but a set of parallel generative systems—phonological, syntactic, and conceptual—connected by a rich system of interface rules. Your "coupling" is a proxy for the complexity and arbitrariness of these interface mappings at different granularities.

The notion of morphemes initiating "decoupling" and constructions "re-coupling" is particularly problematic. It suggests a process, a historical or derivational story, where what's actually at issue is the static architecture of the grammar. From my perspective, both the morpheme `*-ed*` and the construction `*let alone*` are fundamentally the same kind of object: a stored lexical item, a symbolic mapping between a phonological structure, a syntactic structure, and a conceptual structure (a `[PS, SS, CS]` triplet). The difference is not one of "coupling type" but of internal complexity and compositionality. The `*let alone*` construction is simply a larger, more articulated piece of stored linguistic knowledge. It doesn't "re-couple" anything; it is a stored linking rule, just like a morpheme is.

Your "hard-coupled" phonology also misses the point. The key insight is that phonology is its own combinatorial system, with its own primitives (features) and principles of organization (syllable structure, stress). It is not simply a bundle of acoustic cues. A phoneme like `/ɪ/` is a symbolic object in the phonological grammar, which is then *realized* acoustically and articulatorily at the interface with the world. It doesn't have a Conceptual Structure, which is why it feels "hard-coupled"—there's no semantic pole to be separated from. The crucial architectural move is to recognize phonology, syntax, and semantics as autonomous levels of structure, not points on a single continuum of "coupling."

My advice is to re-frame the chapter not around a single gradient, but around the *interfaces*. The core question isn't "how tightly are form and meaning coupled?" but rather, "what is the nature of the interface rules that link phonological, syntactic, and conceptual structures at various levels of complexity?" The phenomena you describe—the arbitrariness of the morpheme, the schematic meaning of a construction—are consequences of the nature of these interface rules. Grounding the chapter in an explicit parallel architecture will make the argument far more robust and less vulnerable to charges of being metaphorical. You are observing real phenomena, but you are describing them with the wrong tools.
