## Part 1: What Kind of Thing Is a Mechanism?

HPC doesn't require mechanisms to be metaphysically simple. It needs them to be **real enough to do stabilizing work**.

### Five Compatible Framings

1. **Mechanisms as organised causal processes**
   - Most common philosophy-of-science view: organised set of parts/activities producing a phenomenon
   - Level-dependent: neural circuit, biochemical cascade, social pipeline, learning dynamic
   - HPC leans on this: mechanisms are whatever organised causal structure keeps the cluster co-instantiating

2. **Mechanisms as "real patterns" rather than essences**
   - Realist about mechanisms without making them micro-essences
   - A mechanism = stable pattern of causal organisation supporting counterfactuals and interventions
   - Fits HPC slogan: categories earn keep because something makes properties hang together

3. **Mechanisms can themselves be HPC kinds** (recursive option)
   - Mechanism type (analogy-based learning, entrenchment, frequency-sensitive generalisation) need not have strict N&S definition
   - Could be cluster of causal features tending to recur across contexts
   - No sharp boundary required for explanatory or real status

4. **Multi-mechanism realism**
   - Naturally pluralist: category maintained by several overlapping mechanisms, none individually necessary
   - "What kind of thing is the mechanism?" → contributory causal strand in braided stabilising story

5. **Model-first humility**
   - Mechanisms partly discovered, partly modelled
   - Commit to *something* in causal structure doing stabilising, even if taxonomy is rough or revision-prone

### One-liner
> Mechanisms are the stabilising causal patterns we are warranted in positing because they make the clustering and its projectibility non-accidental.

## Part 2: Hidden Commitments

### 1. Process ontology
Category ≠ static object. Category = dynamically sustained attractor in population-level causal field.
- Explains: real yet metastable; boundaries sharpen/blur with ecology; same label tracks different causal packages across languages

### 2. Interventionist realism
Reality claims framed around projectibility → interventionist metaphysics:
> A kind is real to the extent that manipulating (or tracking) it reliably changes expectations about downstream properties.
- Metaphysical criterion: real kinds = control-relevant partitions, not just descriptive clusters
- Differentiates HPC-linguistics from purely statistical clustering

### 3. Normatively-inflected naturalism
Categories about what speakers do/learn/generalise/converge on → blurs descriptive regularity and weak normative stability ("what counts as good bet for competent speaker")
- Competence norms are emergent ecological facts
- Way to talk about grammaticality without essences AND without collapsing into taste

### 4. Measurable metaphysics
Reality of category proportional to reliability of inferential work it supports.
- Kindhood as gradient and quantifiable via projectibility metrics
- Operational teeth: entropy reduction, cross-context generalisation accuracy, inter-speaker agreement as function of frequency/entrenchment

### 5. Social ontology of grammar
Stabilising substrate = not just brains but coordination among agents, sustained by institutions/norms, mediated by standardisation/schooling.
- Grammatical kinds = partially social kinds (stabilised by coordination equilibria, not arbitrary)
- Explains: standard varieties produce sharper category effects; stigma/prestige act like selection pressures

### 6. Plural groundings of "the same" category
Multiple sufficient stabilising packages yield similar surface regularities.
- "Noun" as convergent kind: real but multiply realised across typological space
- Crosslinguistic sameness = functional-mechanistic overlap, not identity of defining traits
- Avoids strong universalism AND radical incommensurability

### 7. Mechanism individuation bottleneck (next metaphysical headache)
What counts as *the same* mechanism across contexts?
- Need stance on: when two stabilising stories are instances of one type vs two
- Likely answer: mechanism kinds also cluster-ish, with family resemblances
- Recursion is depth, not bug

### 8. Re-interpretation of theoretical disagreements
Many disputes = disagreements about which stabilising mechanism does work, not which definition is correct.
- New map: not "who has right definition of X?" but "what causal story makes X projectible?"
- Potentially original rhetorical move

## Part 3: The Ten Aphorisms (revised)

1. A grammatical category is not a thing you find; it's a regime you maintain.
2. The ontology of grammar is closer to ecology than taxonomy.
3. Category boundaries are often the visible face of stabilising dynamics.
4. A kind's reality is indexed to the bets it makes safe.
5. "Same category" across languages is a claim about convergent maintenance, not shared essence.
6. Mechanisms are not beneath categories; they are partially sculpted by them.
7. Arguments over definitions are, at bottom, arguments over stabilisers.
8. A label that doesn't project is not false; it's mechanistically underspecified.
9. Discreteness is not a starting point; it's an emergent achievement.
10. The most telling facts about categories live in their failure modes.

## Drop-In Manifesto Paragraph

A grammatical category is not a thing you find; it's a regime you maintain. The ontology of grammar is closer to ecology than taxonomy—boundaries are often the visible face of stabilising dynamics, not arbitrary lines drawn on a continuous space. A kind's reality is indexed to the bets it makes safe: when a category supports reliable induction, something in the world is doing that work. Across languages, "same category" is a claim about convergent maintenance, not shared essence. Mechanisms are not hidden beneath categories; they are partially sculpted by them—a reciprocal loop where learning shapes usage shapes learning. Arguments over definitions are, at bottom, arguments over stabilisers. A label that doesn't project is not false; it's mechanistically underspecified. Discreteness is not a starting point; it's an emergent achievement. And the most telling facts about categories live in their failure modes—where boundaries blur, where judgments diverge, where the stabilising dynamics show their seams.

## Next Frontier Theses (explicit signature claims)

- Grammar is a **population-level causal regime** more than an inventory of mental objects.
- The reality of grammatical kinds is **proportional to their intervention- and prediction-value**.
- Crosslinguistic category sameness is **convergence of stabilising functions**, not identity of defining features.
- Mechanisms and categories form a **two-level homeostatic loop**: categories shape learning/usage which shapes categories.

The last = **reciprocal realism**: mechanisms aren't just beneath categories — they're partly co-constructed by the category systems they stabilise.

## Integration Notes

- Aphorisms 1, 3, 9 fit well as section epigraphs in Ch 7
- Hidden commitments 1–3 could structure Ch 7's middle section
- Commitments 4–6 could structure Part III/IV chapters
- Commitment 7 (mechanism individuation) is explicitly addressed by the "mechanisms as HPC kinds" framing
- The "reciprocal realism" thesis is the signature move — save for conclusion or Ch 14
- Drop-in paragraph ready for Ch 7 or metaphysics chapter opening

## Part 4: Khalidi Alignment Check

### Point-by-Point Assessment

1. **Regime → needs property-hierarchy scaffold**
   - "Regime" risks sounding purely dynamical without the *ordered causal hierarchy of properties* that generates derivative ones

2. **Ecology → still owe a taxonomic payoff**
   - Must show how ecological story explains why *this* partition yields stable, explanatory kinds

3. **Strong agreement** — aligns with rejection of definitional essences

4. **Almost straight Khalidi** — projectibility as core diagnostic for real kinds

5. **Sympathetic** — frame as *similar causal-role profiles* rather than strict identity

6. **Yes, in the right cases** — hook: interactive kinds and looping effects where classifications feed back on what's classified

7. **Likes the re-description** — resonates with sorting real kinds vs vestiges of older schemes

8. **Partial agreement + harder edge:**
   - Sometimes non-projective labels are *conventional* not merely underspecified
   - Tripartite view: mind-dependent yet real vs too convention-linked
   - Gives principled way to say when "underspecified" should become "demote or split"

9. **Comfortable** — so long as you make clear what *core causal structure* yields emergent sharpness

10. **Methodologically congenial** — stress tests reveal real causal nexus vs historically sticky label

### Khalidi-Flavoured Micro-Revisions

- Replace some "mechanism" talk with **"ordered causal hierarchy of properties"** for maximum metaphysical bite
- Build bridge to social-kinds framework when discussing grammar as population-level, coordination-sensitive system — distinguishes causal stabilisation from mere convention

### Key Khalidi References

### Main Value-Add

Sharper rule for when "non-projective" means:
- **"Needs better mechanism"** vs
- **"Isn't the right kind at all"**
