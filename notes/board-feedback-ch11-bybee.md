# Board Member Feedback: Chapter 11 (Word Classes)

**Subject:** Mechanisms of Maintenance and Change

The application of Homeostatic Property Clusters (HPC) to word classes is a significant improvement over essentialist definitions, but I am concerned that your concept of "architectural equilibrium" remains too abstract. From a usage-based perspective, the stability of these categories is not just structural; it is cognitive and probabilistic, driven by **frequency and entrenchment**.

### 1. Frequency and Entrenchment as Stabilizers
You ask what maintains the boundaries of word classes. The answer must include frequency. High token frequency entrenches individual items, allowing them to resist regularization and maintain their category status even when they retain irregular properties (conservative effect). High type frequency helps schematize the category itself, determining its productivity (e.g., how easily we coerce a noun into a verb). The "standing wave" of an HPC is energy-dependent; that energy is repetition in discourse. Without acknowledging entrenchment, your "homeostasis" lacks a cognitive motor.

### 2. Diachronic Evidence
You cannot explain the cross-linguistic stability of Noun/Verb versus the volatility of Adjective/Adverb without diachrony. The "fuzziness" at the boundaries of these categories is often historical residue. You should include evidence of **category shifts**—how lexical items slide from one class to another (e.g., relational nouns becoming adpositions). This gradualness is not a bug; it is the mechanism of renewal. If an HPC is a dynamic system, you must show it in motion. A static snapshot of "variation" misses the directional pressure of change.

### 3. Grammaticalization vs. "Failure Modes"
I urge caution in how you apply Chapter 8's "failure modes" here. When a verb begins behaving like a preposition (e.g., *regarding*, *concerning*), do not diagnose this as a "fat clustering" or a category failure. This is standard grammaticalization. The HPC framework must distinguish between a category that is genuinely ill-defined (lacking homeostatic mechanisms) and an item that is simply traversing a well-worn path of semantic bleaching and decategorialization. Transitional forms are highly projectible if you understand the diachronic path they are on.

**Summary:** Less "architecture," more usage history. The mechanisms of stability are the same mechanisms of change, just operating at different rates.
