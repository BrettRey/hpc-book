## Current State

**COMPLETE:** Chapter 7 now uses cross-linguistic quotatives as the main worked case study.

### What was done this session:

1. **Replaced irregular past tense** with **quotatives** as primary case study
   - *be like* (English), *so* (German), *tte* (Japanese), *diye* (Turkish)
   - Shows thicker braid of stabilisers: processing economy, expressive fit, acquisition pathways, social indexing, transmission
   - Cross-linguistic convergence as flagship demonstration of mechanism-maintained kinds

2. **Added ecology subsection** — colloquialisation as selection environment
   - Weighs Biber/Leech evidence vs counter-evidence
   - Key move: "It is the weather in which the mechanisms operate"
   - New citations: biber1989, leech2009, bibergray2016

3. **Retained evidentials as condensed contrast** (subsection 7.X.7)
   - ~400 words showing "same semantic territory, different architecture"
   - Turkish (tight grammaticalisation) vs Japanese (loose semi-lexical)
   - Ecological explanation: areal contact vs pragmatic hedging
   - Key line: "The ecology is the wind; the mechanisms are the sails"

### Current chapter structure:
1. The cluster (macrophage → nouns)
2. Stabilisers at multiple scales (biology → linguistics mapping)
3. Variation as activation states (*fun*, Polish aspect)
4. **One case in depth: the emergence of quotatives** ← NEW
   - The cluster
   - Stabilisers (5 named)
   - Why the same profile across languages?
   - The wider ecology: colloquialisation and register shift
   - Variation and activation
   - What if a mechanism were absent?
   - A contrast: same semantic territory, different architecture (evidentials)
5. How to test whether a mechanism is real (robustness criteria)
6. Degrees of projectibility
7. Commitments
8. Redemption, not replacement
9. The most telling facts (bridge to failure modes)

### Removed:
- `weinerlabov1983` and `mackenzie2019` citations (were in irregular past tense section)
- Need to re-integrate MacKenzie 2019 elsewhere if desired

---

## Draft files retained:
- `notes/case-study-quotatives.tex` — original standalone draft
- `notes/case-study-evidentials.tex` — full version if expansion needed later

---

## Next session suggestions:
1. **Re-integrate MacKenzie 2019** — the individual→community divergence point could fit in "Variation and activation" or earlier
2. **Review prose flow** — the chapter is now longer; check transitions
3. **Add figure?** — timeline of quotative emergence across languages could be impactful
4. **Continue to Chapter 8** — failure modes


**Integrated citations:**
- MacKenzie 2019 (individual differences → community divergence)
- Weiner & Labov 1983 (processing mechanisms for syntactic variation)

---

## Next Steps

**PRIORITY: Replace "One case in depth" section**

The English irregular past tense is too familiar/cliché. Draft TWO alternatives:

### Option A: Cross-linguistic Quotative Emergence
- Japanese *to*, Turkish *diye*, German *so*, English *be like*
- Same mechanism profile producing similar categories independently
- Processing (economy), frequency, sociolinguistic spread, age-grading
- Accessible, comparative, fresh

### Option B: Evidentials in Japanese vs Turkish
- Turkish: grammaticalised (*-mIş* hearsay/inference vs *-DI* direct)
- Japanese: lexicalised (*rashii*, *sōda*, *tte*)
- Same semantic space, different stabilisation paths
- Why grammaticalised in one, lexicalised in other?
- Comparative and intellectually rich

**After drafting both:**
- Choose one for the main worked case
- Downgrade or remove the other (or move to different chapter)

## Session Summary (2025-12-08)

### Major accomplishments:
1. Complete rewrite of Ch7 with biological explanatory style
2. Replaced facile level-selection passage with went/holp + on/nous examples
3. Added biological template section (later absorbed into chapter style)
4. Integrated MacKenzie 2019 and Weiner & Labov 1983
5. Added and scanned four sociolinguistics papers
6. Renamed literature PDFs to standard format
7. Fixed BibTeX entries

### Files created:
- `notes/biological-analogues.md` — biological template for mechanism talk
- `notes/mackenzie-colloquium.md` — Jan 9 colloquium abstract + relevance
- `notes/sociolinguistics-papers-scan.md` — scan of four papers

### Files modified:
- `chapters/chapter07.tex` — complete rewrite
- `references.bib` — added MacKenzie, Lavandera, Weiner+Labov, Levon+Buchstaller

## Open Questions

1. Should the biological template be explicit (as a named analogy) or implicit (just using the style)?
2. McCloskey/Goldsmith+Laks on "science envy" — decision: don't mention it; let the work speak
3. Which worked case to use: quotatives or evidentials?

---

## For Next Session

1. Research evidentials (Japanese, Turkish) — mechanism profiles, acquisition, grammaticalisation
2. Research quotatives (cross-linguistic) — Japanese *to*, Turkish *diye*, German *so*, age-grading
3. Draft Option A (quotatives)
4. Draft Option B (evidentials)
5. Compare and choose
6. Revise chapter accordingly
