# Chapter 7 Restructure: Status and Next Steps

## Current State

Chapter 7 has been completely rewritten to embody the immunologist's explanatory style:
- Start with the cluster
- Name stabilisers at multiple scales
- Treat variation as activation states
- Show reciprocal causation
- Use robustness tests that fall out of this style

**Both replacement case studies are now drafted:**
- `notes/case-study-quotatives.tex` — Option A: Cross-linguistic quotatives
  - *Ecology subsection:* Colloquialisation as selection environment (not mechanism)
  - Weighs Biber/Leech evidence vs counter-evidence (non-universality, register persistence)
  - Key line: "It is the weather in which the mechanisms operate"
- `notes/case-study-evidentials.tex` — Option B: Japanese vs Turkish evidentials
  - *Ecology subsection:* Areal contact (Eurasian evidential belt) + pragmatic function (Japanese hedging/politeness)
  - Parallel framing: "The ecology is the wind; the mechanisms are the sails"

**Current structure:**
1. The cluster (macrophage → nouns)
2. Stabilisers at multiple scales (biology → linguistics mapping)
3. Variation as activation states (*fun*, Polish aspect)
4. One case in depth (English irregular past tense) — **TO BE REPLACED**
5. How to test whether a mechanism is real (robustness criteria)
6. Degrees of projectibility
7. Commitments
8. Redemption, not replacement
9. The most telling facts (bridge to failure modes)

**Integrated citations:**
- MacKenzie 2019 (individual differences → community divergence)
- Weiner & Labov 1983 (processing mechanisms for syntactic variation)

## Next Steps

**PRIORITY: Replace "One case in depth" section**

The English irregular past tense is too familiar/cliché. Draft TWO alternatives:

### Option A: Cross-linguistic Quotative Emergence
- Japanese *to*, Turkish *diye*, German *so*, English *be like*
- Same mechanism profile producing similar categories independently
- Processing (economy), frequency, sociolinguistic spread, age-grading
- Accessible, comparative, fresh

### Option B: Evidentials in Japanese vs Turkish
- Turkish: grammaticalised (*-mIş* hearsay/inference vs *-DI* direct)
- Japanese: lexicalised (*rashii*, *sōda*, *tte*)
- Same semantic space, different stabilisation paths
- Why grammaticalised in one, lexicalised in other?
- Comparative and intellectually rich

**After drafting both:**
- Choose one for the main worked case
- Downgrade or remove the other (or move to different chapter)

## Session Summary (2025-12-08)

### Major accomplishments:
1. Complete rewrite of Ch7 with biological explanatory style
2. Replaced facile level-selection passage with went/holp + on/nous examples
3. Added biological template section (later absorbed into chapter style)
4. Integrated MacKenzie 2019 and Weiner & Labov 1983
5. Added and scanned four sociolinguistics papers
6. Renamed literature PDFs to standard format
7. Fixed BibTeX entries

### Files created:
- `notes/biological-analogues.md` — biological template for mechanism talk
- `notes/mackenzie-colloquium.md` — Jan 9 colloquium abstract + relevance
- `notes/sociolinguistics-papers-scan.md` — scan of four papers

### Files modified:
- `chapters/chapter07.tex` — complete rewrite
- `references.bib` — added MacKenzie, Lavandera, Weiner+Labov, Levon+Buchstaller

## Open Questions

1. Should the biological template be explicit (as a named analogy) or implicit (just using the style)?
2. McCloskey/Goldsmith+Laks on "science envy" — decision: don't mention it; let the work speak
3. Which worked case to use: quotatives or evidentials?

---

## For Next Session

1. Research evidentials (Japanese, Turkish) — mechanism profiles, acquisition, grammaticalisation
2. Research quotatives (cross-linguistic) — Japanese *to*, Turkish *diye*, German *so*, age-grading
3. Draft Option A (quotatives)
4. Draft Option B (evidentials)
5. Compare and choose
6. Revise chapter accordingly
