# Chapter 9 (Countability) — Board Feedback (Michael Tomasello)

## Overall take

This chapter is a welcome departure from essentialist accounts of linguistic categories. The core thesis—that "countability" is not a static binary definition but a homeostatic cluster maintained by usage and inference—aligns strongly with the **usage-based, constructivist** view of language acquisition. The rejection of a "dictionary definition" in favor of a dynamic system that children must navigate and construct is exactly right.

However, from a developmental perspective, the account of *how* this cluster is built needs refinement. The current draft risks treating the "bidirectional inference" mechanism as a logical engine that children turn on, rather than a statistical and social process of construction. The gap between the pre-linguistic object cognition (Spelke) and the adult grammaHere is the feedback from Michael Tomasello on Chapter 9:

**Overall Take:**
This chapter is a welcome departure from essentialist accounts of linguistic categories. The core thesis—that "countability" is not a static binary definition but a homeostatic cluster maintained by usage and inference—aligns strongly with the **usage-based, constructivist** view of language acquisition. The rejection of a "dictionary definition" in favor of a dynamic system that children must navigate and construct is exactly right. However, from a developmental perspective, the account of *how* this cluster is built needs refinement. The current draft risks treating the "bidirectional inference" mechanism as a logical engine that children turn on, rather than a statistical and social process of construction.

**Critique of the Acquisition Pathway:**
The chapter identifies the right endpoints (core object cognition $\to$ adult count syntax) but compresses the developmental trajectory. You state that "Children don't learn count properties one by one," but in fact, my research (and that of Lieven, Pine, etc.) shows that early language is **item-based**. A child will say "two cups" and "two shoes" long before they have a generalized "two [THING]" construction. They are productive with specific items while being "conservative" with others (the **Island of Reliability** phenomenon). The "count cluster" is not a template the child downloads; it is an emergent generalization that arises from the accumulation of these specific exemplars. The text implies the cluster arrives earlier and more abruptly than it does.

**Missing Developmental Evidence:**
To make the "mechanism" story robust, you need to add the engine that drives the abstraction: **type frequency**. You mention overgeneralization ("three sheeps"), but you don't explain *why* it happens. Children only abstract the "count noun" category after hearing counting syntax applied to a sufficient *variety* of distinct nouns. High *token* frequency entrenches specific items (keeping "cattle" irregular), while high *type* frequency drives the abstraction of the slot `[two UNIT]`. Furthermore, while you cite Spelke for object perception, you miss the **social-pragmatic** dimension. We don't just perceive objects; we **jointly attend** to them. The "functional anchor" you mention is ultimately grounded in the need to single out individuals for joint attention. The cluster coheres because it serves this communicative function, not just because of perceptual edge detection.
st perceive objects; we **jointly attend** to them. The "functional anchor" you mention for *cattle* vs. *cow* is ultimately grounded in joint attention: we have a specific word (*cow*) to direct attention to the individual agent. This social-pragmatic dimension strengthens your argument: the "cluster" coheres because it serves a communicative function (identifying manipulable topics of joint attention), not just because neurons fire for edges.

### The "Conservative" Child
Before they overgeneralize, children are **conservative**. They will refuse to pluralize a novel noun if they haven't heard it. This conservatism is the "viscosity" in your hydrodynamic metaphor—it's what keeps the system stable before the "basin" fully forms. Acknowledging this would fit your "chunking" section well.

## (3) Summary of Recommendations

1.  **Soften the "Instant Cluster" implication**: Acknowledge that the coupling takes years to fully emerge and passes through an item-based stage where the "cluster" is fragmented or non-existent for the child.
2.  **Add Type Frequency**: It is the concrete statistical mechanism that builds the "locks" you describe.
3.  **Ground the "Anchor" Socially**: Connect "functional anchoring" to the pragmatic need to single out individuals for joint attention.
