# HPC Book Project Status

**Date**: November 29, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Initialization & Planning

## Completed

- ✅ Project repository initialized
- ✅ Directory structure created (`chapters/`, `code/`, `figures/`, `build/`, `notes/`)
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured for LaTeX/academic project
- ✅ README.md with project overview
- ✅ Synopsis finalized (~880 words)
- ✅ Core thesis articulated
- ✅ 14-chapter structure defined (4 parts: Problem, Fix, Categories, Implications)

## In Progress

- 🔄 Chapter 1 drafting (Sections 1.1 and 1.2 complete)
- 🔄 Example identification and development
- 🔄 Bibliography compilation (Initial batch imported)

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Ch 1-2 Drafts** - The Problem (Part I)
   - Ch 1: What are grammatical categories?
   - Ch 2: Essentialism and its discontents (furniture, weak definites)

2. **Example Development**
   - Expand the */the/* example from synopsis
   - Develop countability cases (for Ch 9)
   - Document definiteness puzzles (for Ch 10)
   - Collect word class boundary cases (for Ch 11)

3. **Research Infrastructure**
   - Set up bibliography system (BibTeX)
   - Identify key papers to cite in Ch 5 (HPC in biology)
   - Create example tracking document

### Short-term (This Month)
1. Create detailed chapter outlines for Parts I-II
2. Draft key examples with linguistic data
3. Begin bibliography (philosophy of science, linguistics, semantics)
4. Identify figures/diagrams needed

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Months)
1. Draft Part I chapters
2. Draft Part II chapters
3. Develop case studies for Part III
4. Create visualizations

### Long-term (6 Months)
1. Complete all chapters
2. Revise and refine
3. Prepare for manuscript submission

## Key Challenges to Address

1. **Balance depth and accessibility**: Philosophy + linguistics audience
2. **Example selection**: Need compelling, clear cases that show mechanism at work
3. **Cross-linguistic evidence**: What data is needed to support claims?
4. **Engagement with existing literature**: What must be cited/addressed?
5. **Methodology chapter**: Do we need explicit methods discussion?

## Research Questions to Pursue

- What are the specific mechanisms for each grammatical category?
- How do we empirically test for homeostasis in grammar?
- What are the clearest failure cases (non-HPC categories)?
- How does this framework interact with formal/computational approaches?
- What predictions does HPC make that essentialism doesn't?

## Resources Needed

- [ ] Access to linguistic corpora
- [ ] Bibliography management (BibTeX/Zotero)
- [ ] LaTeX template for book manuscript
- [ ] Diagram/figure creation tools
- [ ] Example tracking system
