# HPC Book Project Status

**Date**: December 11, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Part II Drafting Complete; Citation Refinement Session

## Completed

- ✅ Project repository initialized with Git
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured for LaTeX/academic project
- ✅ README.md with project overview
- ✅ Synopsis finalized (~880 words)
- ✅ Core thesis articulated (HPC kinds for grammatical categories)
- ✅ 14-chapter structure defined (4 parts: Problem, Fix, Categories, Implications)
- ✅ House style guide established (`.house-style/style-guide.md`)
- ✅ LaTeX preamble with custom macros (`.house-style/preamble.tex`)
- ✅ Bibliography system (BibTeX with Biber backend)

### Part I: The Problem (Chapters 1-3)
- ✅ **Ch 1**: Words That Won't Hold Still - drafted and revised
- ✅ **Ch 2**: Essentialism and its Discontents - drafted and revised
- ✅ **Ch 3**: What We Haven't Been Asking - drafted and revised

### Part II: The Fix (Chapters 4-8)
- ✅ **Ch 4**: Homeostatic Property Clusters - drafted and revised
- ✅ **Ch 5**: Discrete from Continuous - drafted and revised
- ✅ **Ch 6**: Projectibility and the Good Bet - drafted and revised
- ✅ **Ch 7**: The Stabilisers - drafted and revised (quotatives case study)
- ✅ **Ch 8**: Failure Modes - drafted (thin/fat/negative taxonomy)

### Citation & Bibliography Work (Dec 11, 2025)
- ✅ Literature folder reorganized: 9 PDFs moved from `islands/` subfolder
- ✅ PDFs renamed to match BibTeX keys (standardized naming)
- ✅ Page references added to 8 citations across chapters 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- ✅ 3 verbatim quotations added (Millikan, Craver, Kirby)

## In Progress

- 🔄 Part III outlining (Chapters 9-12: case studies)

## Next Actions

### Immediate
1. **Part III Planning** - Create master notes for Ch 9-12 case studies
2. **Ch 9 Outline** - Countability as first Part III case study

### Short-term (This Month)
1. Begin Ch 9 (Countability) drafting
2. Collect cross-linguistic data for Part III case studies
3. Review and update bibliography for Part III

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Months)
1. Draft Part III chapters (9-12)
2. Draft Part IV chapters (13-14)
3. Create visualizations and figures

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Quotatives case study** selected for Ch 7 (cross-linguistic, recent data)
2. **O'Connor integration** for Ch 8 (payoff vs property distinction)
3. **Madagascar analogy** for grain-of-analysis problem
4. **Two-Diagnostic Test** framework (projectibility + homeostasis)
5. **PDF naming convention**: Match BibTeX keys exactly

## Key Files

- `chapters/chapter01.tex` through `chapter08.tex` - Main chapter files
- `notes/CHAPTER_OUTLINE.md` - Authoritative chapter structure
- `notes/chapter07-master.md` - Consolidated Ch 7 notes (pattern for other chapters)
- `notes/chapter08-master.md` - Ch 8 failure modes notes
- `notes/oconnor-and-hpc-levels.md` - O'Connor engagement and grain-of-analysis
- `literature/stack.tex` - Standalone paper manuscript (HPC stack)
- `synopsis.md` - Book synopsis

## Recent Session Work (Dec 11, 2025)

### Citation Refinement
| Chapter | Citation | Added |
|---------|----------|-------|
| 1 | `huddleston2002` | `[ch.~1]` |
| 3 | `spike2020` | `[13--15]` |
| 3 | `dahl2016` | `[435--436]` |
| 4 | `millikan1984` | `[ch.~1]` |
| 4 | `craver2009` | `[575]` |
| 5 | `kirby2008` | `[10681]` |
| 6 | `favier2021` | `[Table~2]` |
| 8 | `miller2021` | `[25--26]` |

### Verbatim Quotations Added
- **Millikan 2017 p. 17** (Ch 4): Self-maintaining kinds depleting resources
- **Craver 2009 p. 575** (Ch 4): "Kind concepts cut nature at its joints"
- **Kirby 2008 p. 10681** (Ch 5): "invisible hand" process

## Research Questions Addressed

- ✅ What are the specific mechanisms for grammatical categories? (Ch 7)
- ✅ How do we empirically test for homeostasis? (Ch 7 robustness tests)
- ✅ What are the clearest failure cases? (Ch 8 thin/fat/negative)
- ✅ How does this interact with formal/computational approaches? (Ch 8 criteria)
- ✅ What predictions does HPC make that essentialism doesn't? (Ch 6, 7)
