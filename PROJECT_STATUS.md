# HPC Book Project Status

**Date**: March 3, 2026
**Current Phase**: 17-chapter draft + postscript; new Ch 13 (sign language anaphor) planned. Revision/polish phase.

### Session (Mar 3, 2026): Editorial decisions + new chapter decision

**Editorial decisions resolved:**
- ✅ **PA → footnote** (Ch 1): Jackendoff paragraph moved to footnote on "third possibility" pivot
- ✅ **Peirce tightening** (Chs 9, 12): Reduced would-be repetition in Ch 9 (8→3); cut Ch 7 recap and redundant Peirce attribution in Ch 12
- ✅ **Discourse scope-limit** (Ch 13): Visible sentence before stabilizer-weighting map + table footnote
- ✅ **Budding expansion** (Ch 17): 4 sentences → ~450 words. New terms: budding, mechanism parasitism
- ✅ **CC-BY 4.0** on colophon; GitHub repo URL added
- ✅ **"Foundations of linguistics"** named as subfield in preface

**Architectural decision:**
- ✅ **New Ch 13: Sign language anaphor** -- tests modality independence of HPC architecture. Spatial loci as formal cluster, referent tracking as semantic cluster. Current Ch 13 (stack) → Ch 14; Part IV chapters renumber (15--18). Full scoping notes: `notes/ch13-sign-anaphor-scope.md`
- Book becomes **18 chapters** + postscript
- Literature pass needed before writing (Sandler & Lillo-Martin 2006, Schlenker 2018, Padden 1988, Cormier et al., village sign languages)

**Next session:** Start with `notes/ch13-sign-anaphor-scope.md`. Literature pass first, then chapter structure, then drafting.

### Multi-day instance (Feb 28 -- Mar 2, 2026): 18 commits, major structural and editorial work

**Structural:**
- ✅ **Split Ch 16 → Ch 16 + Ch 17**: Ch 16 ("How Categories Travel") and Ch 17 ("The Gauntlet") now separate chapters. Book is 17 chapters + postscript.
- ✅ **Predictions appendix (Appendix C)**: 30 numbered predictions + 2 defeat conditions gathered from across the book.
- ✅ **Postscript created**: ~370 words on "language" as a category the book doesn't address.
- ✅ **Cross-reference infrastructure**: index tags, section labels, `\ref` conversions, Ch 15 prose fixes.
- ✅ **Definiteness thread**: new `\definiteness` environment, added to Ch 9, removed from Chs 14-15.

**Ch 16 (How Categories Travel):**
- ✅ Metaphor paper integration, projectibility restoration, embodiment reply
- ✅ Counting diagnostic, functional domain definition, painted-line case, Noyes & Keil development
- ✅ Trail passage: show-first-name-second rewrite
- ✅ Prose tightening, LLM nuance, covariation honesty
- ✅ TCM-gauntlet connection; Canudas-Grabolosa et al. (2026) homesigner study integrated

**Ch 17 (The Gauntlet):**
- ✅ Ladyman & Ross attribution, Figure 17.1 revision, Sancho Panza epigraph
- ✅ **§17.2 full rewrite** ("What HPC opens"): 5 expert-perspective Sonnet agents (Boyd, Haspelmath, Kendler, Bybee, Borsboom) identified convergent criticisms. Disentangled Kendler MPC from Borsboom network theory; fixed DSM to polythetic; acknowledged Mayr's BSC already mechanistic; addressed Haspelmath's cross-linguistic gap; three psychiatry-linguistics disanalogies. Now distinguishes "reframes" / "imports" / "opens."

**Projectibility-as-constitutive correction:**
- ✅ ~20 edits across 8 chapters restoring projectibility as third constitutive leg of Boyd's HPC (not downstream bonus). Ch 16 synthesis ledger fully rewritten.

**Humour audit:**
- ✅ Full-book scan with Sonnet + Codex agents; combined report in `notes/humour-audit-combined.md`
- ✅ Ch 3: evaluated ~20 additions critically (Tier 1/2/3), applied 17 (Tiers 1+2)
- ✅ Ch 13: 8 meaning-bearing inserts

**Prose and voice:**
- ✅ Revoiced Chs 11, 13; aphoristic prose audit
- ✅ Ch 12: sex/social-gender/grammatical-gender diagnostic
- ✅ Boyd circle fix (textcite for inline citations)
- ✅ Ch 15: five prose fixes

**Gauntlet reframing (conceptual):**
- Diagnosed that gauntlet predictions test maintenance degradation, not projection
- Budding-not-fission insight for grammaticalization
- Diff-in-diff across biology/psychiatry/ecology/linguistics
- Full notes: `notes/gauntlet-reframing-2026-02-28.md`

**Bibliography:** `borsboom2017` added; zero undefined citations; 492 pages clean.

**Process note:** Brett corrected me for implementing humour additions without critical evaluation. Always evaluate before implementing.

### Session Work (Feb 25, 2026: Index cleanup + lexical gloss audit)
- ✅ **HPC "applied to linguistics" reclassification completed**: 4 straggler tags fixed (ch03→`!defined`, ch05→`!cross-linguistic`, ch09→`!lexical categories`, ch14→`!grammaticality`). Zero bare or `!applied` tags remain.
- ✅ **Lexical index gloss audit**: all 16 unglossed foreign-language entries now glossed across ch06, ch10, ch11, ch12 (Japanese, Turkish, Swahili, Latin, French, German, Greek). Rule: every non-English entry gets a gloss.
- ✅ **Build verified**: 453 pages, all 4 indexes regenerate cleanly (0 makeindex warnings)
- **Not yet committed**

### Session Work (Feb 25, 2026: Bibliography audit complete)
- ✅ **Two-pass bibliography audit** across ~292 entries in central bib
  - Pass 1: 17 fixes (fabricated authors, wrong entry types, incorrect pages/years/DOIs)
  - Pass 2: 3 fixes (ross1967 redundant note, pullum2025 pages, ekstrom2025 now published)
  - All fixes verified via Crossref API
- ✅ **Local bib/chapter fixes**: fortson2004 author format, chapter11 citation key Gibson2026→gibson2025
- ✅ **Cover page**: removed provisional-citations warning; draft disclaimer retained
- ✅ **Final scan**: 2 remaining "advance online" / "forthcoming" entries confirmed genuinely unpublished (O'Doherty, Scott-Phillips)
- **Commits:** `a092be0`, `6ea519e` on `ch16-prose-rewrite`, pushed
- **Note:** Biber 2.19 cache corruption encountered; fixed by clearing PAR temp cache

### Session Work (Feb 24, 2026 late: House-style batch fixes from editorial reports)
- ✅ **All 9 editorial batch-fix tasks completed** across 16 chapter files (-64 lines net):
  - Em-dash → en-dash in epigraph attributions (11 files)
  - Backtick-tick quotes → `\enquote{}` (10 files)
  - Bare `*` → `\ungram` markers (6 files, 11 instances)

  - `\citet` → `\textcite` standardisation (11 files, 68 instances)
  - Semantic macro fixes: `\emph{}` → `\term{}` for term introductions; `\textit{}` → `\mention{}` for linguistic forms (6 files, 10 instances)
  - "HPC kind" → "HPC category" in book's own voice (7 files, ~23 instances); kept "kind" in Boyd attributions and philosophical contrasts
  - Mechanical: Ch 4 grammar fix, Ch 2 table caption, Ch 14 LBE expansion, Ch 6 forward-reference tense (4 instances), Ch 4 `\term{Noun}` → `\term{noun}`
- ✅ **Decision:** Ch 15 stays in Part IV
- **Commit:** `20994a3` on `ch16-prose-rewrite`, pushed
- **Remaining editorial work:**
  - Ch 16 weak landing (second worked example, Ladyman & Ross, practical methodology)
  - Peirce earned-or-imposed audit (Chs 7, 9–14)
  - Discourse level missing from Ch 13 summary table
  - Stabiliser vs mechanism terminology consistency
  - Parallel Architecture paragraphs (Chs 1, 3)
  - Bold labels in prose (~40+ instances, Chs 6, 7, 8, 10, 13)
  - Peirce branch merge (`projectibility-pivot` → `ch16-prose-rewrite`)
  - Bib style-field normalisation

### Session Work (Feb 24, 2026 PM: Full editorial review + critical bug fixes)
- ✅ **16 chapter précis** written (parallel agents), 300-500 words each
- ✅ **Book-level editorial report** identifying 11 cross-chapter issues
- ✅ **16 chapter-level editorial reports** (deep reads, parallel agents)
- ✅ **Critical bugs fixed**:
  - Ch 12: removed spurious `[*]` from ~27 grammatical examples (was marking everything ungrammatical)
  - Ch 14: fixed Markdown `*emphasis*` → `\emph{}` (2 instances)
  - Ch 14: replaced undefined MMMG abbreviation (4 instances)
  - Ch 9: fixed `\\mention` double-backslash + deleted orphaned draft line

- ✅ **Editorial followups tracker** created (`notes/precis/editorial-followups.md`)
- **Commit**: `53f0e12` on `ch16-prose-rewrite`
- **Next**: Batch house-style fixes (bold labels, backtick quotes, `\mention{}`, "HPC kind" → "HPC category", `\begin{exe}` → `\ea/\z`)

### Session Work (Feb 24, 2026: Figure/table audit + new figures)
- ✅ **Table/figure audit completed** (carried over from prior session):
  - Added cross-references to 16 previously unreferenced floats across 9 chapters
  - Relabelled `fig:10:decoupling` → `tab:10:decoupling` (tabular in figure env)
  - Renamed Ch 7 images from `6.*` to `7.*` prefix
  - Archived 17 orphaned images to `figures/archive/`
- ✅ **New Fig 13.1** (coupling-tightness spectrum): Gemini-generated four-panel image (crystalline→emergent-web), LaTeX label wrapper with small-caps coupling types and mediation axis. Placed before §13.1.
- ✅ **New Fig 16.1** (evaluation gauntlet): TikZ flowchart — three debts → gauntlet box (predictions + stress tests) → confirm/narrow/downgrade verdicts. Placed in §16.1 intro.
- ✅ **Phase-transition figure (Ch 3) reviewed**: Identified flat-honeycomb ice as chemically inaccurate. Attempted matplotlib replacement (saved as `3.phase-transition-v2.png`); visually not publication-grade. Parked — options: better Gemini prompt with crystallography instructions, Wikimedia CC composite, or leave as-is.
- ✅ **All committed** in `e7e503a` on `ch16-prose-rewrite` branch.
- **New files**: `figures/13.coupling-spectrum.png`, `notes/fig-13-coupling-spectrum-prompt.md`, `code/phase_transition_figure.py`, `figures/3.phase-transition-v2.png`

### Session Work (Feb 23, 2026: Ch 15 substantive revision)
- **Value proposition clarified**: Ch 15 explains why categories are *shared* (individual mechanisms don't explain community convergence). Social mechanisms complete the maintenance story.
- **Variationist calibration**: Honest about limits — HPC doesn't give variationists new empirical questions; it makes their implicit ontology explicit. Vindicates Milroy/Eckert mechanism requirement. Mechanism ablation prediction made explicit (network dissolution → dialect levelling).
- **Two-plus-overlap model**: Dialect (community) and register (activity) as two mechanistic dimensions; discourse community reframed as their convergence zone, not a third kind. Reflexive HPC paragraph added.
- **Ch 14 callbacks**: Register mismatch ≠ ungrammaticality (double-copula); grammaticality judgments as partly indexical products (§15.5 closing).
- **De-jargoned**: All Bayesian notation removed; O'Connor similarity-maximizing models passage simplified.
- **Protocol subsection (§15.4.1) cut**: Methods-manual voice; defeat test folded into preceding paragraph.
- **Pagination fixes (global, preamble.tex)**: Widow/orphan 10000→150; parskip 0pt→0pt plus 1pt; needspace sections 5→4, subsections 4→3. Net: 407→401 pages.
- **Stale transitions fixed**: Ch 10 was skipping Ch 11 (lexical categories) and pointing to Ch 12 (gender); Ch 12 was pointing backward to Ch 11 as "the final case study" instead of forward to Ch 13 (zipper); Ch 13 phoneme Object gloss tightened with "its value."
- **Commits**: `79d7a55`, `2fef3f0`, `bcfbb5b`, `3f00e36` on `ch16-prose-rewrite`

### Session Work (Feb 22, 2026: shared-bib cleanup tranche C completed)
- ✅ **All remaining duplicate-signature groups resolved** in shared `references.bib`:
  - Closed all 19 `possible_duplicate_record` groups with canonical-record consolidation.
  - Removed duplicate records and kept canonical metadata (including validated DOI/title fixes for high-ambiguity items).
  - Updated in-text cites to canonical keys where needed (`bybee2015`→`bybee1994`, `croft2001radical`→`croft2001`, `pickeringgarrod2004`→`pickering2004`).
- ✅ **Audit tooling improved**:
  - `code/audit_cited_bib.py` now resolves BibLaTeX `ids={...}` aliases, so cited-audit output reflects true Biber resolution behavior.
- ✅ **Verification pass completed**:
  - `latexmk -g hpc-book.tex` successful (existing non-fatal warnings unchanged).
  - `python3 code/audit_full_bib.py --bib references.bib --date 2026-02-22`: **770 entries, 2 info issues, 0 warnings, 0 duplicate-record groups**.
  - `python3 code/audit_cited_bib.py --bcf build/hpc-book.bcf --date 2026-02-22`: **292/292 cited keys resolved, 0 missing, 0 cited-entry warnings** (3 keys resolved via aliases).
  - Refreshed reports:
    - `notes/full-bib-audit-2026-02-22.md`
    - `notes/full-bib-audit-2026-02-22.json`
    - `notes/cited-bib-audit-2026-02-22.md`
- ⚠️ **Scope note**: tranche-C bib edits were made in the symlink target (`../../.house-style/references.bib`), not as tracked changes in this repo.

### Session Work (Feb 22, 2026: shared-bib cleanup tranche B completed)
- ✅ **All tranche-B warnings resolved** in shared `references.bib`:
  - Merged DOI-duplicate record groups using canonical keys plus alias preservation via `ids={...}`.
  - Normalized invalid year format (`Davies2008COCA`: `year={2008}` with status/access details moved to `note`).
  - Repaired required-field gaps by correcting entry types/fields:
    - `GelmanLoken2013` → `@unpublished`
    - `bechtel2005explanation` → `@article` with `journal`, `number`, `doi`
    - `baird2001` → `@mastersthesis` + `school`
    - `winter2002` → `@phdthesis` + `school`
- ✅ **Metadata sanity checks run** against Crossref for high-uncertainty items:
  - `10.1016/j.shpsc.2005.03.010`
  - `10.1177/0142723719869731`
  - `10.1017/9781009085748`
- ✅ **Verification pass completed**:
  - `latexmk hpc-book.tex` successful.
  - `python3 code/audit_cited_bib.py --bcf build/hpc-book.bcf --date 2026-02-22 --strict`: `292/292` cited keys resolved, `0` missing.
  - Biber case-mismatch warnings eliminated.
  - Updated full-bib state: **790 entries, 22 issues, 0 warnings** (down from 799/41/13 warnings after tranche A).
- ⚠️ **Scope note**: tranche-B bib edits were made in the symlink target (`../../.house-style/references.bib`), not as tracked changes in this repo.

### Session Work (Feb 22, 2026: shared-bib cleanup tranche A completed)
- ✅ **Case-collision normalization completed** in shared `references.bib`:
  - Removed duplicate case-variant keys for the same works (e.g., `Huddleston2002`, `Sperber1996`, `Haspelmath2010`, `Rosch1973`, `Rosch1975`).
  - Renamed the true non-duplicate collision pair key `Downing1996` to `downing1996propernames` to avoid key-space collision with `downing1996`.
- ✅ **In-repo citation updates** applied:
  - `chapters/chapter11.tex`: `Haspelmath2010` → `haspelmath2010`
  - `chapters/chapter15.tex`: `Sperber1996` → `sperber1996`
- ✅ **Verification pass completed**:
  - `latexmk hpc-book.tex` successful; no undefined-citation warnings.
  - `python3 code/audit_cited_bib.py --bcf build/hpc-book.bcf --date 2026-02-22 --strict`: `292/292` cited keys resolved, `0` missing, `0` cited-entry warnings.
  - Updated full-bib reports: `notes/full-bib-audit-2026-02-22.md` and `notes/full-bib-audit-2026-02-22.json`.
  - Full-bib state now: **799 entries, 41 issues, 0 case-collision groups** (down from 811 entries / 69 issues / 13 case-collision groups).
- ⚠️ **Scope note**: shared bib edits were made in the symlink target (`../../.house-style/references.bib`), not as tracked changes in this repo.

### Session Work (Feb 22, 2026: full shared-bib audit workflow)
- ✅ **Implemented full-bib audit tool**: `code/audit_full_bib.py` (full source integrity checks with suggestions).
- ✅ **Produced baseline reports**:
  - `notes/full-bib-audit-2026-02-22.md`
  - `notes/full-bib-audit-2026-02-22.json`
- ✅ **Current full-bib baseline** (shared `references.bib`):
  - 811 entries, 69 issues total
  - 13 case-collision key groups
  - 12 DOI-level duplicate-record groups
  - 1 non-standard year format (`2008--2025`)
  - 4 missing required fields
  - style-mix signals (`journal`/`journaltitle`, `year`/`date`, `address`/`location`)

### Session Work (Feb 22, 2026: cited-only BibTeX audit + citation resolution)
- ✅ **Resolved all currently missing cited keys** in full-book build:
  - Loaded local source in preamble (`\addbibresource{references-local.bib}`).
  - Added `eckert2008indexical` to `references-local.bib`.
  - Corrected key mismatches in chapter prose (`wiese2023grammatical` → `wiese2023`; `Reynolds2026` remapped to specific existing keys).
- ✅ **Implemented cited-only audit tooling**:
  - Added `code/audit_cited_bib.py` (reads citekeys from `build/hpc-book.bcf`, audits only cited entries).
  - Generated report: `notes/cited-bib-audit-2026-02-22.md`.
- ✅ **Verification complete**:
  - `latexmk hpc-book.tex` completed successfully.
  - `build/hpc-book.log` no longer reports undefined citations.
  - Audit result: `292/292` cited keys resolved, `0` missing.
- ✅ **Bibliography hygiene follow-through completed**:
  - Cited-entry metadata warnings resolved (date-only entries normalized with explicit `year`; `forthcoming` year fields converted to integer year plus `note`).
  - Audit parser hardened to ignore commented-out BibTeX stubs and accept `date`/`journaltitle` when auditing cited records.
  - Updated audit result: `292/292` cited keys resolved, `0` missing, `0` cited-entry warnings, `0` duplicate keys in loaded sources.
- ⚠️ **Remaining upstream bib noise (outside cited-only scope)**:
  - Biber still reports 13 case-mismatch key pairs in shared `references.bib` (e.g., `huddleston2002`/`Huddleston2002`).

### Session Work (Feb 22, 2026: Ch 16 gauntlet finalization + board loop)
- ✅ **Ch 16 rebuilt as a true gauntlet**: risky predictions, explicit falsifiers, serious-downgrade criterion, and operational thresholds consolidated in `chapters/chapter16.tex`.
- ✅ **Running case hardened** (`\mention{data}`): diagnostics now aligned to Ch 9 framing (agreement + tight/loose packaging + anchoring recession) rather than generic variation talk.
- ✅ **ABM evidentiary discipline aligned to Ch 7/9 updates**: Ch 16 now states that didactic ABMs are mechanism sketches; defeat claims must rely on replicated corpus/behavioural data, with seed distributions and ablation controls treated as internal checks.
- ✅ **Review-board cycle completed**:
  - `notes/board-report-ch16-2026-02-22.md` (revamp board synthesis)
  - `notes/board-report-ch16-post-revision-2026-02-22.md` (post-revision readiness verdict)
- ✅ **Build verification**: repeated `latexmk hpc-book.tex` runs successful; pre-existing repo warnings remain (multiply-defined label, missing glyph).
- ✅ **Pushed commits**:
  - `f7eff65` Ch 16 gauntlet revisions + board follow-up
  - `6b626da` Ch 16 ABM criteria alignment with Ch 7/9

### Session Work (Feb 22, 2026: Ch 7/9 ABM robustness pass)
- ✅ **Chapter 7 ABM refinement**: explicit 20-seed robustness summary and clearer calibration limits for the volcanic-island toy model.
- ✅ **Chapter 9 ABM refinement**: scaling-control clarification, 20-seed distributional summaries, and freeze-learning control added to reinforce mechanism-claim discipline.

### Immediate
1. Normalize remaining style-mix fields (`journal`/`journaltitle`, `address`/`location`) in shared `references.bib`.
2. Run a targeted overfull/underfull pass on high-visibility tables/figures in Chs 9, 13, and 16.
3. Optional tooling follow-up: add `bibtexparser` to local env or make `code/validate_bib.py` fallback-compatible.

### Session Work (Feb 20, 2026 evening: Ch 11 + Ch 8 + Ch 9 polish with Brett)
- ✅ **Ch 11 HPC-consistency pass**: Fixed "semantics comes along for the ride" (essentialist smuggling → coupling framing); rewrote compressed Reynolds 2024 paragraph for accessibility; /w/ → /hw/ (Brett's dialect); "wh-in-situ" → "languages where IRE words remain in situ"; maintenance-only paragraph → maintenance + projection profiles; Ch 12 transition rewritten (morphological gender absence → pro-form diffusion); "adjective" carving: epistemologically and ontologically distinct, terminologically identical; "at least three" categories for *who*; dropped redundant Ch 12 forward reference
- ✅ **Ch 8 structural fix**: Moved curtain line ("Categories generate habits; classes are merely named") from §8.7 to actual chapter end after §8.9 coupling coda. Added "Two tools make them operational" transition.
- ✅ **Ch 9 tricolon**: LEGO opening reordered (law, money, style guide) for bathetic punchline
- ✅ **Bib cleanup**: Deleted duplicate `reynolds2024` entry; citation now uses `reynolds2024why`
- ✅ **Coupling vs braiding**: Confirmed as distinct concepts (form-meaning poles vs mechanism convergence). Both terms stay.

### Session Work (Feb 20, 2026: Ch 11 Review Board + Polish)
- ✅ **Six-reviewer board** (Bybee, Tomasello, Croft, McCloskey, Chater, Zimmer): 24 edits from convergent criticisms (type/token frequency, structural analogy qualification, Baker grant-before-take, constructional thickness, IRE cross-linguistic caveat, lyrebird mapping, HPC-vs-definitional disconfirmation)
- ✅ **Structural rhetorical figures** (9): epistrophe, gradatio, anadiplosis, inclusio, isocolon, diacope, anadiplosis cycle, antithesis, ring composition (Wallace callback)
- ✅ **Selective humor** (10 of 26 evaluated): "wrong enough to be interesting" opener, "embarrassingly practical" deflation, "nobody will be harmed", "drawer not theory", "doing no work whatsoever", "English declines to issue a ruling", "family colours", lyrebird caption, table caveat
- ✅ **Ch 11 complete**: 6 sections (Intro, Skeleton, Thin, Wastebasket, Braid, Looking Forward). Not final-final, but put to bed.

### Session Work (Feb 19–20, 2026: Ch 11 §11.4–§11.5 + Ch 13 Architecture)
- ✅ **§11.4 (Adverbs) polished**: reynolds2024 integrated, grammar-teaching sociology, Penn Treebank claim fixed, meta-HPC typological grounding (Rijkhoff 2007)
- ✅ **§11.5 (Pronouns/Mimics) drafted**: Two-faced cluster (syntactic + semantic), core personal pronouns + Ch 12 gender connection, three saturation routes, IRE words coined, braiding conclusion
- ✅ **Terminology hardened**: category vs. class vs. label; no "kind"; wh- = phonology not morphology; "participates in the system of case"
- ✅ **Anti-essentialist discipline**: Multiple essentialist gatekeepers caught and fixed
- ✅ **Ch 13 restructuring decided**: Coupling concept as Ch 8 coda, Ch 13 as synthesis chapter. Analysis in `notes/ch13-restructuring-analysis.md`. Status: "try"

### Session Work (Feb 19, 2026: Sync Conflict Resolution)
- ✅ **Major Sync Conflict Resolved**: 
  - Identity 130 duplicate files (e.g., `chapter11 2.tex`, `.git/refs/heads/master 2`) caused by iCloud sync error.
  - Automated diff verification: 129 project files were identical; 3 git metadata files were stale pointers to Dec 2024.
  - All duplicates deleted from filesystem and `.git` internal structure.
- ✅ **Repository Health**: 
  - Restored `chapters/chapter15.tex` and `notes/chapter15_planning.md` from Git (missing from disk).
  - Deleted stale/partial `literature2` folder.
  - `git status` now clean; "U" markers removed from explorer.
- ✅ **Documentation Update**: `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and session logs back-filled for Feb 15-17 gap.
- 🔄 **Chapter 11 Reset**: Archived old draft and starting fresh to better align with HPC maintenance framing.

### Session Work (Feb 17, 2026: Nefdt Response Analysis)
- ✅ **Nefdt (2025) Analysis**: Conducted deep-dive into "real patterns" and linguistic communities.
- ✅ **Synthesis**: Compared Nefdt's structuralism extension to metasemantics with HPC maintenance view. Outlined response strategy focusing on overgeneration and grounding.

### Session Work (Feb 16, 2026: Multi-Agent Peer Review)
- ✅ **Review Simulation**: Dispatched 6 independent LLM agents (personas: expert to outsider) to simulate peer reviews for tree independence polynomials / network motifs paper.
- ✅ **Revision**: Revised paper based on round 1 feedback; evaluated in round 2.

### Session Work (Feb 15, 2026: Mode-Mean Bound & Cluster Slack)
- ✅ **Mode-Mean Bound**: Integrated computational evidence and investigation findings into the manuscript.
- ✅ **Cluster Slack Hypothesis**: Derived rigorous proof using hard-core recurrence relation to bound cluster load $\le |C_v|/3$.

### Session Work (Jan 31, 2026: Reviewer Synthesis)
- ✅ **Feedback Synthesis**: Consolidated critiques from Peirce, Plato, and Aristotle personas. Prioritized revisions to address core philosophical grounding and argument marginal gains.

### Session Work (Jan 23, 2026: Formal Architecture Reconciliation)
- ✅ **Architecture Refined**: "Six components" reframed as diagnostic failure modes.
- ✅ **Variables established**: Three constitutive variables + dynamics (HPC energy function $E(\omega;u,c)$).
- ✅ **Dynamics**: discrete-time Bayesian/Beta update established as primary model.
- ✅ **Chapter 15 Substantially Expanded** ("The Social Stabilization of Kinds"):
  - **Dialect subsection**: Added Halliday 1978 "variety according to user", Labov's "orderly heterogeneity" with AAVE example, HPC resolution (boundaries ontologically sharp but epistemically inaccessible per Ch 5)
  - **Register subsection**: Added Halliday's field/tenor/mode, Biber 1988 multidimensional analysis, HPC resolution (registers as attractor basins maintained by gatekeeping)
  - **Discourse Community subsection**: Added Swales 1990 definition and six criteria, HPC resolution (communities as latent mixture components, coordination equilibria)
  - **New "Conditioning Structure" subsection**: Synthesizes three mechanisms as unified conditioning structure (dialect=persistent parameterization, register=situational conditioning, community=mixture component)
- ✅ **Bibliography entries added** (all verified via web search):
  - `halliday1978` – *Language as Social Semiotic*, Edward Arnold
  - `biber1988` – *Variation across Speech and Writing*, CUP
  - `swales1990` – *Genre Analysis*, CUP
- ✅ **Build verified**: 379 pages, compiles cleanly
- **Key decision**: Gradience is within categories; boundaries are ontologically sharp but epistemically inaccessible

### Session Work (Jan 20, 2026: Chapter 15 Creation & LBE Integration)
- ✅ **New Chapter 15 Created** ("The Social Stabilization of Kinds"):
  - Split from Part IV to give "Varieties as Conditioning" its own chapter.
  - Core argument: Variation is a latent mixture; varieties are the stabilizers.
  - Old Chapter 15 ("Nominalist Challenge") moved to Chapter 16.
  - `hpc-book.tex` updated to include `chapter15.tex` and `chapter16.tex`.
- ✅ **LBE Integrated** (Reynolds 2026):
  - **Ch 8**: "Left Branch Gap" added as Negative Diagnosis case study.
  - **Ch 13**: $k=4$ packaging tightness added as evidence for coupling strength.
