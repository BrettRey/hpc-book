### Part III: Categories Reconsidered (Chapters 9-12)
- ✅ **Ch 9**: Countability - drafted and refined (LEGO/emoji hooks, cross-linguistic section)

### Session Work (Dec 15-16, 2025)
- ✅ Terminology standardized: "linguistic categories" throughout (Chs 2, 3, 5)
- ✅ Ch 13 theoretical framework developed:
  - MMMG (Morphosyntactic-Meaning Model of Grammaticality)
  - CP/effect-space analysis (why phonemes don't carry propositional meaning)
  - Information-theoretic framing (Shannon mutual information, Kolmogorov complexity)
  - Turkish vowel harmony as key evidence
  - "A orange" edge case analysis (allomorphy, not phonotactics)
- ✅ Notes consolidated:
  - `chapter13-master.md` — quick-reference theoretical framework
  - `chapter13_planning.md` — structural planning (double-copula vignette)
  - `morphosyntax-systematicity-zone.md` — comprehensive deep-dive (~8,700 words)
- ✅ Ch 5 TODO added: synchronic terrain warping (context shifts basin boundaries)
- ✅ CxG foundational arguments notes created

### Session Work (Dec 17, 2025)
- ✅ Scott-Phillips 2025 (byproduct hypothesis) integrated:
  - Ch 7 Table 7.1: optimal relevance as forcing function
  - Ch 8: methodological caution about acceptability judgments
- ✅ Fedorenko 2024 papers integrated:
  - "Language network as natural kind" → Ch 4 (neural evidence for HPC)
  - "Communication rather than thought" → Ch 7 (dissociation confirms communicative forcing function)
- ✅ Advisory board consultations (4 agents each) for both papers
- ✅ Build workflow fixed: `latexmk` now recommended for `build/` output
- ✅ Bib entries updated/added for new citations

### Session Work (Dec 20, 2025)
- ✅ Chapter 11 grist developed:
  - Deixis/anaphor/interrogative theoretical discussion
  - Mechanism-braiding insight: semantic redundancy → syntactic distribution
  - Focus-modifier squib sparked parallel project
  - Pro-form as semantic category — cross-reference to `reynolds2025proform`
- ✅ Pro-form gender paper (`literature/pro-form_gender.tex`) integrated as Ch 11 source
- ✅ Bib entry added: `reynolds2025proform` (manuscript in preparation)
- ✅ `notes/chapter11-grist.md` created with clustering tables and mechanism analysis

## In Progress

- 🔄 Part III development (Chapters 10-12: remaining case studies)
- 🔄 Ch 13 theoretical framework → prose draft

## Next Actions

### Immediate
1. **Ch 10 Outline** - Definiteness as second Part III case study
2. **Ch 11 Outline** - Lexical categories (noun/verb contrast)
3. **Ch 14 Mereology Section** - Typed mereology content from `linguistics-mereology/` project; projectability as field-specificity criterion

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Months)
1. Draft Part III chapters (9-12)
2. Draft Part IV chapters (13-14)
3. Create visualizations and figures

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Quotatives case study** selected for Ch 7 (cross-linguistic, recent data)
2. **O'Connor integration** for Ch 8 (payoff vs property distinction)
3. **Madagascar analogy** for grain-of-analysis problem
4. **Two-Diagnostic Test** framework (projectibility + homeostasis)
5. **PDF naming convention**: Match BibTeX keys exactly

## Key Files

- `chapters/chapter01.tex` through `chapter08.tex` - Main chapter files
- `notes/CHAPTER_OUTLINE.md` - Authoritative chapter structure
- `notes/chapter07-master.md` - Consolidated Ch 7 notes (pattern for other chapters)
- `notes/chapter08-master.md` - Ch 8 failure modes notes
- `notes/oconnor-and-hpc-levels.md` - O'Connor engagement and grain-of-analysis
- `literature/stack.tex` - Standalone paper manuscript (HPC stack)
- `synopsis.md` - Book synopsis

## Recent Session Work (Dec 11, 2025)

### Citation Refinement
| Chapter | Citation | Added |
|---------|----------|-------|
| 1 | `huddleston2002` | `[ch.~1]` |
| 3 | `spike2020` | `[13--15]` |
| 3 | `dahl2016` | `[435--436]` |
| 4 | `millikan1984` | `[ch.~1]` |

### Verbatim Quotations Added
- **Millikan 2017 p. 17** (Ch 4): Self-maintaining kinds depleting resources
- **Craver 2009 p. 575** (Ch 4): "Kind concepts cut nature at its joints"
- **Kirby 2008 p. 10681** (Ch 5): "invisible hand" process

## Research Questions Addressed

- ✅ What are the specific mechanisms for linguistic categories? (Ch 7)
- ✅ How do we empirically test for homeostasis? (Ch 7 robustness tests)
- ✅ What are the clearest failure cases? (Ch 8 thin/fat/negative)
- ✅ How does this interact with formal/computational approaches? (Ch 8 criteria)
- ✅ What predictions does HPC make that essentialism doesn't? (Ch 6, 7)
