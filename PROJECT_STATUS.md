# HPC Book Project Status

**Date**: December 10, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Part II Drafting Complete; Part III Outlined

## Completed

- ✅ Project repository initialized with Git
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured for LaTeX/academic project
- ✅ README.md with project overview
- ✅ Synopsis finalized (~880 words)
- ✅ Core thesis articulated (HPC kinds for grammatical categories)
- ✅ 14-chapter structure defined (4 parts: Problem, Fix, Categories, Implications)
- ✅ House style guide established (`.house-style/style-guide.md`)
- ✅ LaTeX preamble with custom macros (`.house-style/preamble.tex`)
- ✅ Bibliography system (BibTeX with Biber backend)

### Part I: The Problem (Chapters 1-3)
- ✅ **Ch 1**: Words That Won't Hold Still - drafted and revised
- ✅ **Ch 2**: Essentialism and its Discontents - drafted and revised
- ✅ **Ch 3**: What We Haven't Been Asking - drafted and revised

### Part II: The Fix (Chapters 4-8)
- ✅ **Ch 4**: Homeostatic Property Clusters - drafted and revised
- ✅ **Ch 5**: Discrete from Continuous - drafted and revised
- ✅ **Ch 6**: Projectibility and the Good Bet - drafted and revised
- ✅ **Ch 7**: The Stabilisers - drafted and revised (quotatives case study)
- ✅ **Ch 8**: Failure Modes - initial draft complete (thin/fat/negative taxonomy)

## In Progress

- 🔄 Chapter 8 refinement (O'Connor engagement, intervention operationalisation)
- 🔄 Part III outlining (Chapters 9-12: case studies)

## Next Actions

### Immediate
1. **Ch 8 Polish** - Refine prose, add missing citations (O'Connor 2019, Reynolds 2025)
2. **Part III Planning** - Create master notes for Ch 9-12 case studies

### Short-term (This Month)
1. Begin Ch 9 (Countability) drafting
2. Collect cross-linguistic data for Part III case studies
3. Review and update bibliography for Part III

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Months)
1. Draft Part III chapters (9-12)
2. Draft Part IV chapters (13-14)
3. Create visualizations and figures

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Quotatives case study** selected for Ch 7 (cross-linguistic, recent data)
2. **O'Connor integration** for Ch 8 (payoff vs property distinction)
3. **Madagascar analogy** for grain-of-analysis problem
4. **Two-Diagnostic Test** framework (projectibility + homeostasis)

## Key Files

- `chapters/chapter01.tex` through `chapter08.tex` - Main chapter files
- `notes/CHAPTER_OUTLINE.md` - Authoritative chapter structure
- `notes/chapter07-master.md` - Consolidated Ch 7 notes (pattern for other chapters)
- `notes/chapter08-master.md` - Ch 8 failure modes notes
- `notes/oconnor-and-hpc-levels.md` - O'Connor engagement and grain-of-analysis
- `literature/stack.tex` - Standalone paper manuscript (HPC stack)
- `synopsis.md` - Book synopsis

## Research Questions Addressed

- ✅ What are the specific mechanisms for grammatical categories? (Ch 7)
- ✅ How do we empirically test for homeostasis? (Ch 7 robustness tests)
- ✅ What are the clearest failure cases? (Ch 8 thin/fat/negative)
- 🔄 How does this interact with formal/computational approaches? (Ch 8 criteria)
- ✅ What predictions does HPC make that essentialism doesn't? (Ch 6, 7)
