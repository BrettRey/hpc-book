# HPC Book Project Status

**Date**: February 22, 2026
**Current Phase**: Full 16-chapter draft in place; Part IV gauntlet/ABM evidence refinement active

### Session Work (Feb 22, 2026: Ch 16 gauntlet finalization + board loop)
- ✅ **Ch 16 rebuilt as a true gauntlet**: risky predictions, explicit falsifiers, serious-downgrade criterion, and operational thresholds consolidated in `chapters/chapter16.tex`.
- ✅ **Running case hardened** (`\mention{data}`): diagnostics now aligned to Ch 9 framing (agreement + tight/loose packaging + anchoring recession) rather than generic variation talk.
- ✅ **ABM evidentiary discipline aligned to Ch 7/9 updates**: Ch 16 now states that didactic ABMs are mechanism sketches; defeat claims must rely on replicated corpus/behavioural data, with seed distributions and ablation controls treated as internal checks.
- ✅ **Review-board cycle completed**:
  - `notes/board-report-ch16-2026-02-22.md` (revamp board synthesis)
  - `notes/board-report-ch16-post-revision-2026-02-22.md` (post-revision readiness verdict)
- ✅ **Build verification**: repeated `latexmk hpc-book.tex` runs successful; pre-existing repo warnings remain (multiply-defined label, missing glyph).
- ✅ **Pushed commits**:
  - `f7eff65` Ch 16 gauntlet revisions + board follow-up
  - `6b626da` Ch 16 ABM criteria alignment with Ch 7/9

### Session Work (Feb 22, 2026: Ch 7/9 ABM robustness pass)
- ✅ **Chapter 7 ABM refinement**: explicit 20-seed robustness summary and clearer calibration limits for the volcanic-island toy model.
- ✅ **Chapter 9 ABM refinement**: scaling-control clarification, 20-seed distributional summaries, and freeze-learning control added to reinforce mechanism-claim discipline.

### Immediate
1. Run final bibliography pass for currently unresolved citation keys.
2. Do a targeted overfull/underfull pass on high-visibility tables/figures in Chs 9, 13, and 16.
3. Decide whether to keep all generated ABM diagnostic figures in-repo or archive non-book artifacts.

### Session Work (Feb 20, 2026 evening: Ch 11 + Ch 8 + Ch 9 polish with Brett)
- ✅ **Ch 11 HPC-consistency pass**: Fixed "semantics comes along for the ride" (essentialist smuggling → coupling framing); rewrote compressed Reynolds 2024 paragraph for accessibility; /w/ → /hw/ (Brett's dialect); "wh-in-situ" → "languages where IRE words remain in situ"; maintenance-only paragraph → maintenance + projection profiles; Ch 12 transition rewritten (morphological gender absence → pro-form diffusion); "adjective" carving: epistemologically and ontologically distinct, terminologically identical; "at least three" categories for *who*; dropped redundant Ch 12 forward reference
- ✅ **Ch 8 structural fix**: Moved curtain line ("Categories generate habits; classes are merely named") from §8.7 to actual chapter end after §8.9 coupling coda. Added "Two tools make them operational" transition.
- ✅ **Ch 9 tricolon**: LEGO opening reordered (law, money, style guide) for bathetic punchline
- ✅ **Bib cleanup**: Deleted duplicate `reynolds2024` entry; citation now uses `reynolds2024why`
- ✅ **Coupling vs braiding**: Confirmed as distinct concepts (form-meaning poles vs mechanism convergence). Both terms stay.

### Session Work (Feb 20, 2026: Ch 11 Review Board + Polish)
- ✅ **Six-reviewer board** (Bybee, Tomasello, Croft, McCloskey, Chater, Zimmer): 24 edits from convergent criticisms (type/token frequency, structural analogy qualification, Baker grant-before-take, constructional thickness, IRE cross-linguistic caveat, lyrebird mapping, HPC-vs-definitional disconfirmation)
- ✅ **Structural rhetorical figures** (9): epistrophe, gradatio, anadiplosis, inclusio, isocolon, diacope, anadiplosis cycle, antithesis, ring composition (Wallace callback)
- ✅ **Selective humor** (10 of 26 evaluated): "wrong enough to be interesting" opener, "embarrassingly practical" deflation, "nobody will be harmed", "drawer not theory", "doing no work whatsoever", "English declines to issue a ruling", "family colours", lyrebird caption, table caveat
- ✅ **Ch 11 complete**: 6 sections (Intro, Skeleton, Thin, Wastebasket, Braid, Looking Forward). Not final-final, but put to bed.

### Session Work (Feb 19–20, 2026: Ch 11 §11.4–§11.5 + Ch 13 Architecture)
- ✅ **§11.4 (Adverbs) polished**: reynolds2024 integrated, grammar-teaching sociology, Penn Treebank claim fixed, meta-HPC typological grounding (Rijkhoff 2007)
- ✅ **§11.5 (Pronouns/Mimics) drafted**: Two-faced cluster (syntactic + semantic), core personal pronouns + Ch 12 gender connection, three saturation routes, IRE words coined, braiding conclusion
- ✅ **Terminology hardened**: category vs. class vs. label; no "kind"; wh- = phonology not morphology; "participates in the system of case"
- ✅ **Anti-essentialist discipline**: Multiple essentialist gatekeepers caught and fixed
- ✅ **Ch 13 restructuring decided**: Coupling concept as Ch 8 coda, Ch 13 as synthesis chapter. Analysis in `notes/ch13-restructuring-analysis.md`. Status: "try"

### Session Work (Feb 19, 2026: Sync Conflict Resolution)
- ✅ **Major Sync Conflict Resolved**: 
  - Identity 130 duplicate files (e.g., `chapter11 2.tex`, `.git/refs/heads/master 2`) caused by iCloud sync error.
  - Automated diff verification: 129 project files were identical; 3 git metadata files were stale pointers to Dec 2024.
  - All duplicates deleted from filesystem and `.git` internal structure.
- ✅ **Repository Health**: 
  - Restored `chapters/chapter15.tex` and `notes/chapter15_planning.md` from Git (missing from disk).
  - Deleted stale/partial `literature2` folder.
  - `git status` now clean; "U" markers removed from explorer.
- ✅ **Documentation Update**: `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and session logs back-filled for Feb 15-17 gap.
- 🔄 **Chapter 11 Reset**: Archived old draft and starting fresh to better align with HPC maintenance framing.

### Session Work (Feb 17, 2026: Nefdt Response Analysis)
- ✅ **Nefdt (2025) Analysis**: Conducted deep-dive into "real patterns" and linguistic communities.
- ✅ **Synthesis**: Compared Nefdt's structuralism extension to metasemantics with HPC maintenance view. Outlined response strategy focusing on overgeneration and grounding.

### Session Work (Feb 16, 2026: Multi-Agent Peer Review)
- ✅ **Review Simulation**: Dispatched 6 independent LLM agents (personas: expert to outsider) to simulate peer reviews for tree independence polynomials / network motifs paper.
- ✅ **Revision**: Revised paper based on round 1 feedback; evaluated in round 2.

  - **Register subsection**: Added Halliday's field/tenor/mode, Biber 1988 multidimensional analysis, HPC resolution (registers as attractor basins maintained by gatekeeping)
  - **Discourse Community subsection**: Added Swales 1990 definition and six criteria, HPC resolution (communities as latent mixture components, coordination equilibria)
  - **New "Conditioning Structure" subsection**: Synthesizes three mechanisms as unified conditioning structure (dialect=persistent parameterization, register=situational conditioning, community=mixture component)
- ✅ **Bibliography entries added** (all verified via web search):
  - `halliday1978` – *Language as Social Semiotic*, Edward Arnold
  - `biber1988` – *Variation across Speech and Writing*, CUP
  - `swales1990` – *Genre Analysis*, CUP
- ✅ **Build verified**: 379 pages, compiles cleanly

1. **Ch 13 Rewrite** - Synthesis chapter; coupling coda already in Ch 8. Narrative needs rebuilding around new architecture.
2. **Ch 12 Review** - Draft exists and was polished Jan 8; needs review-board pass like Ch 11 got.
3. **Ch 14 Draft** - Grammaticality itself; framework ready, prose needed.

### Medium-term
1. Draft Ch 14–15 (Part IV)
2. Create remaining visualizations and figures
3. Peirce integration on `projectibility-pivot` branch (Chs 7, 9–14 touched; not yet merged)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Quotatives case study** selected for Ch 7 (cross-linguistic, recent data)
2. **O'Connor integration** for Ch 8 (payoff vs property distinction)
3. **Madagascar analogy** for grain-of-analysis problem
4. **Two-Diagnostic Test** framework (projectibility + homeostasis)
5. **PDF naming convention**: Match BibTeX keys exactly

## Research Questions Addressed

- ✅ What are the specific mechanisms for linguistic categories? (Ch 7)
- ✅ How do we empirically test for homeostasis? (Ch 7 robustness tests)
- ✅ What are the clearest failure cases? (Ch 8 thin/fat/negative)
- ✅ How does this interact with formal/computational approaches? (Ch 8 criteria)
- ✅ What predictions does HPC make that essentialism doesn't? (Ch 6, 7)
