- ✅ Added "for free from domain-general object cognition" phrasing
- ✅ Refined "Looking forward" section for Part III transition
- ✅ Full book PDF compiled (160 pages): `HPC-Book-Full-2025-12-14.pdf`

### Previous Session Work (Dec 13-14, 2025)
- ✅ Cross-reference audit completed
- ✅ Précis added to frontmatter
- ✅ Chapter 8 final editorial pass
- ✅ Chapter 9 two-HPC architecture (individuation + count cluster)
- ✅ LEGO/emoji hooks integrated

## In Progress

- 🔄 Part III development (Chapters 10-12: remaining case studies)

## Next Actions

### Immediate
1. **Ch 10 Outline** - Definiteness as second Part III case study
2. **Ch 11 Outline** - Lexical categories (noun/verb contrast)

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Months)
1. Draft Part III chapters (9-12)
2. Draft Part IV chapters (13-14)
3. Create visualizations and figures

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Quotatives case study** selected for Ch 7 (cross-linguistic, recent data)
2. **O'Connor integration** for Ch 8 (payoff vs property distinction)
3. **Madagascar analogy** for grain-of-analysis problem
4. **Two-Diagnostic Test** framework (projectibility + homeostasis)
5. **PDF naming convention**: Match BibTeX keys exactly

## Key Files

- `chapters/chapter01.tex` through `chapter08.tex` - Main chapter files
- `notes/CHAPTER_OUTLINE.md` - Authoritative chapter structure
- `notes/chapter07-master.md` - Consolidated Ch 7 notes (pattern for other chapters)
- `notes/chapter08-master.md` - Ch 8 failure modes notes
- `notes/oconnor-and-hpc-levels.md` - O'Connor engagement and grain-of-analysis
- `literature/stack.tex` - Standalone paper manuscript (HPC stack)
- `synopsis.md` - Book synopsis

## Recent Session Work (Dec 11, 2025)

### Citation Refinement
| Chapter | Citation | Added |
|---------|----------|-------|
| 1 | `huddleston2002` | `[ch.~1]` |
| 3 | `spike2020` | `[13--15]` |
| 3 | `dahl2016` | `[435--436]` |
| 4 | `millikan1984` | `[ch.~1]` |
| 4 | `craver2009` | `[575]` |
| 5 | `kirby2008` | `[10681]` |
| 6 | `favier2021` | `[Table~2]` |
| 8 | `miller2021` | `[25--26]` |

### Verbatim Quotations Added
- **Millikan 2017 p. 17** (Ch 4): Self-maintaining kinds depleting resources
- **Craver 2009 p. 575** (Ch 4): "Kind concepts cut nature at its joints"
- **Kirby 2008 p. 10681** (Ch 5): "invisible hand" process

## Research Questions Addressed

- ✅ What are the specific mechanisms for grammatical categories? (Ch 7)
- ✅ How do we empirically test for homeostasis? (Ch 7 robustness tests)
- ✅ What are the clearest failure cases? (Ch 8 thin/fat/negative)
- ✅ How does this interact with formal/computational approaches? (Ch 8 criteria)
- ✅ What predictions does HPC make that essentialism doesn't? (Ch 6, 7)
