Every analysis of every construction presupposes a distinction between grammatical and ungrammatical. The asterisk's the most common symbol in syntax. But what's the asterisk diagnosing?

Chapter~\ref{ch:what-we-havent-been-asking} asked a question almost no one asks: is grammaticality itself a natural kind? Not whether this sentence's grammatical, but what kind of thing we're probing when we ask. This chapter provides the answer.

If categories are homeostatic property clusters, then grammaticality isn't merely a binary switch. It's itself an HPC~-- a maintained coupling between form and value. And the feeling of ungrammaticality that guides our judgments isn't an oracle; it's a noisy detector, shaped by entrenchment and processing ease, capable of illusions.

Chapter~\ref{ch:dynamic-discreteness} introduced a two-layer picture: discrete grammaticality filtered through processing noise to yield gradient acceptability. What we're adding here's the question of what \term{kind} of thing grammaticality is, and what maintains it.


\section{The HPC claim}
\label{sec:14:hpc-claim}

Grammaticality's a form--value pairing. But the \enquote{value} side isn't compositional semantics~-- not truth conditions, not the full propositional content. It's something more basic: \term{structural meaning}.

Structural meaning's what grammar contributes before lexical content fills the slots. It includes dependency relations, like the bracketing that distinguishes [\mention{the dogs'}] \mention{house} (a house belonging to the dogs) from \mention{the} [\mention{dogs' house}] (a type of house). It includes argument structure, distinguishing \mention{the dog bit the man} from \mention{the man bit the dog}. 

It provides temporal anchoring through tense and aspect, distinguishing whether the biting's past, ongoing, or hypothetical. It sets the clause type, distinguishing statements (\mention{he was bit}) from questions (\mention{was he bit?}) or commands (\mention{bite him.}). And it manages information structure~-- the difference between \mention{Him, he was bit} and \mention{it was him who was bit}.

This is \term{subcompositional}~-- it's the instruction manual, not the assembled product. Grammar tells you how to wire the meanings; the lexicon provides what to wire. \mention{Colorless green ideas sleep furiously} has perfect wiring instructions and absurd components. That's why it feels strange but not \term{ungrammatical}.

A note on what structural meaning isn't. It's not semantic coherence (\mention{Colorless green ideas} shows grammaticality survives semantic absurdity). It's not contextual felicity (a sentence can be grammatical and pragmatically infelicitous). And it's not whatever the hearer infers (inference runs on many channels; grammaticality's specifically the morphosyntactic one). Structural meaning's the contribution of form to interpretation~-- the \term{wiring diagram}, not the current flowing through it.

The HPC claim, then, is that grammaticality's the coupling between morphosyntactic form and this structural semantics. When the coupling holds~-- when the form reliably signals the structural meaning~-- the sentence sits in the \term{grammatical basin}. When it doesn't, the sentence's outside.

This is the \term{zipper}: morphosyntax provides one set of teeth, structural meaning the other. Grammaticality's what it feels like when the zipper closes. An ungrammatical sentence's a zipper that won't mesh.

Two metaphors will recur. The zipper describes the relation~-- the form--value alignment itself. The \term{immune system} (below) describes the \term{maintenance mechanism}~-- what pushes the system back toward stable couplings when they slip. One's structure; the other's dynamics.


\section{The stabilizer: a feeling}
\label{sec:14:stabilizer}

What maintains this coupling? Partly the mechanisms we've discussed throughout: acquisition, entrenchment, alignment, transmission. But the proximate \term{stabilizer}~-- the thing that corrects deviations in real time~-- is a \term{feeling of ungrammaticality}.

When something's wrong with the form--value coupling, speakers notice. They hesitate, repair, rephrase. The feeling's what triggers the correction. It's the immune response of the grammar.

The feeling's a \term{detector}~-- and like all detectors, it's noisy. It's not a direct readout of the underlying structure. Instead, it's informed by probability and processing ease. First, the detector's Bayesian: a novel sentence's weighted by its likelihood under the distribution of attested forms~-- not just distance from the nearest exemplar, but probability given the entire pattern. Low-probability forms feel suspect even when grammatically licensed. The distribution itself is built by entrenchment: exposure tunes the prior. 

Second, sentences that parse smoothly feel grammatical; sentences that induce garden-paths or reanalysis feel suspect. Processing difficulty isn't the same as ungrammaticality, but the detector often conflates them. This is why \term{acceptability} and \term{grammaticality} come apart. Acceptability's what the detector reports. Grammaticality's the category~-- the HPC whose core's the form--value coupling. The two usually align, but they don't always.

\subsection{Entrenchment in action}

But here's the puzzle: if grammaticality \emph{is} the maintained coupling, and entrenchment's what maintains it, then \enquote{tuning the detector} and \enquote{shaping what counts as grammatical} aren't separable. The detector isn't just tracking some pre-existing reality; the reality's constituted by what gets entrenched. The feeling tracks the coupling, and the coupling's entrenched. All the way down.

This is language-specific, construction-specific, even register-specific.

Consider age expressions: in French and Spanish, age's expressed with \mention{avoir}/\mention{tener}: \mention{J'ai vingt ans} (\enquote{I have twenty years}). In English, *\mention{I have twenty years}'s ungrammatical as a statement of age~-- though perfectly fine as a statement of time (until retirement, on the job, etc.). The structural slot's the same; the construction-specific entrenchment differs. 

The same applies to progressive aspect. If you're describing an ongoing event while your fingers are moving across a keyboard, \mention{I write} mis-signals aspect in English~-- many speakers experience this as \enquote{wrong} in the specific sense of a form--value mismatch. The progressive (\mention{I'm writing}) isn't merely preferred; it's required for the ongoing-action construal. In French, the simple present would be grammatical for the same construal; the progressive's marked or absent. What counts as a violation of the form--value coupling depends on what the community's entrenched.

Countability follows the same pattern. Whether \mention{furniture} takes count morphosyntax depends on entrenchment, not metaphysics. Furniture's as individuable as anything~-- you can count chairs and tables. But English has entrenched \mention{furniture} as noncount, so *\mention{I bought two furnitures}'s ungrammatical. Other languages make different choices. The coupling's real; its contents are conventional.

And consider deitality: what requires the definite article in English~-- \mention{go to the hospital} vs.~\mention{go to hospital} (British)~-- is shaped by entrenchment within each dialect. The structural meaning (institutionalized activity frame)'s the same; the morphosyntactic realization differs.

These examples show grammaticality isn't a window onto universal logic. It's a window onto what a community's entrenched as the couplings between form and structural meaning. The feeling of ungrammaticality's tracking those couplings~-- but the couplings are historical, contingent, and maintained.

And here's where the entrenchment story connects to the social: entrenchment's always entrenchment \enquote{within a discourse community}. The grammar isn't floating free; it's tethered to the people who use it. When the community shifts~-- through contact, migration, register change~-- the entrenchment shifts with it. What feels ungrammatical in one community may be unremarkable in another.

But speakers flow between communities~-- sometimes instantaneously~-- and communities can be created on the fly. \mention{Do you lift?} licenses intransitive \mention{lift} for weightlifters but not for warehouse workers; the grammaticality of the construction depends on which community you're invoking, and you can switch in mid-conversation. Code-switching within a clause~-- \mention{Vamos a hacer shopping}~-- is governed grammar, not error, but only within the discourse community of the bilinguals who maintain it. The detector isn't calibrated once; it's calibrated to whoever you're talking to, right now.

One more piece. We couldn't correct grammatical errors if we couldn't derive the intended meaning without the grammar. When someone says \ungram\mention{I have twenty years} for their age, we understand what they mean~-- and then we notice the mismatch. The feeling of ungrammaticality arises from comparison: the grammar's value versus the intended value. We need both to detect the error. This means comprehension's partly independent of grammaticality~-- and grammaticality's partly a matter of checking the grammar's signal against other inference channels. When they align, we don't notice; when they mismatch, we do.


\section{Grammaticality illusions}
\label{sec:14:illusions}

The strongest evidence that the feeling is dissociable from the structure comes from \term{grammaticality illusions}~-- cases where the detector misfires.

\subsection{Feels ungrammatical, is grammatical}

The classic case is the garden-path sentence:

\ea[]{\label{ex:14:garden-path}
\mention{The horse raced past the barn fell.}}
\z

This is grammatical~-- a reduced relative clause (\mention{the horse [that was] raced past the barn fell}). But the processing system commits to the main-clause parse (\mention{the horse raced past the barn}) and crashes when \mention{fell} appears. The detector reports ungrammaticality; the structure's fine.

\subsection{Feels grammatical, is ungrammatical}

The converse is the \term{comparative illusion}~-- sometimes called the \term{Escher sentence}:

\ea[]{\label{ex:14:comparative-illusion}
\mention{More people have been to Russia than I have.}}
\z

Each local chunk parses. \mention{More people have been to Russia}~-- fine. \mention{Than I have}~-- fine as a comparative clause. But the whole doesn't compose: what's being compared? The sentence has no coherent interpretation, yet it feels acceptable because each piece satisfies local constraints.

These illusions are exactly analogous to visual illusions. The Müller-Lyer lines are the same length, but the perceptual system reports otherwise. The illusion doesn't show perception's broken; it shows perception is a mechanism with characteristic failure modes. Grammaticality illusions show the same: the feeling's a detector, not an oracle.

\textcite{phillips2011grammatical} develop this point systematically, showing comprehension exhibits \term{selective fallibility}~-- impressive accuracy for some constraints, and systematic vulnerability for others. The pattern reveals the architecture: a retrieval system that's structure-sensitive when structural cues have temporal priority, and error-prone when they don't.


\section{What doesn't count}
\label{sec:14:negative-space}

The form--value coupling's specifically morphosyntactic. This predicts what won't trigger ungrammaticality. It excludes phonetic errors, like \mention{[fɪlɔzəfi]} for \mention{philosophy}, where the form's wrong but the morphosyntax's untouched. It excludes lexical errors, like saying \mention{airport} when you meant \mention{train station}. And it excludes semantic anomaly, like \mention{Colorless green ideas sleep furiously}, where the wiring's impeccable even if the components are absurd.

These violations trigger different responses. Phonetic errors trigger \mention{what?} because the phoneme's value's the contrast~-- that's the entire form--value coupling at that level, and when it breaks, comprehension stalls. Lexical errors trigger correction or confusion. Semantic anomaly triggers puzzlement. But none of them trigger the specific feeling of ungrammaticality~-- the sense the wiring's broken.

A revealing contrast comes from the allomorphy of the indefinite article. We reject \ungram{*a apple} and \ungram{*an banana} with the same immune response we bring to syntax. This looks phonological, but the selection rule's entrenched as a grammatical requirement~-- part of the morphosyntactic zipper. A mispronunciation of \mention{banana} would trigger \mention{what?}; distributing the wrong allomorph of the article triggers the grammar's immune response. This is exactly what we'd expect from an HPC: the edge case reveals the boundary of the morphosyntactic coupling, and the feeling of ungrammaticality~-- however muted~-- is the trace of the immune system at work.

\subsection{Value at every grain}

What's \enquote{value} at each level of the grammar? The zipper closes differently depending on what you're zipping.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Grain} & \textbf{Form} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Phoneme & Sound segment & Contrast (minimal-pair distinctiveness) \\
Morpheme & Affix, stem & Grammatical or derivational modification \\
Word & Phonological shape & Lexical meaning + category membership \\
Construction & Syntactic pattern & Argument structure, information structure, meaning template \\
Clause type & Structural configuration & Illocutionary force (statement, question, command) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Form--value coupling at different grains of grammar.}
\label{tab:form-value-grains}
\end{table}

At the phonemic level, value's nothing \emph{but} contrast. The /p/ in \mention{pat} contributes no semantic content; it just distinguishes the word from \mention{bat}, \mention{cat}, \mention{sat}. When contrast fails~-- when you can't tell which phoneme was intended~-- you say \mention{what?}

At the morphemic level, value's the contribution to word meaning or grammatical function. The \mention{-ed} in \mention{walked} signals past tense; the \mention{un-} in \mention{unhappy} reverses polarity. Break the coupling~-- use \mention{-ed} on a noun, or \mention{un-} on a verb that doesn't license it~-- and ungrammaticality results.

At the word level, value's lexical meaning plus category membership. \mention{Dog} contributes dog-ness \emph{and} nounhood. Substitute the wrong word and you get confusion; use a word in the wrong category slot and you get ungrammaticality.

At the constructional level, value's the structural meaning the pattern contributes. The double-object construction (\mention{gave her the book}) signals transfer plus affected recipient. The \term{passive} (\mention{was eaten}) demotes the agent. Break the construction's slot-filling requirements and the zipper won't close.

At the clause-type level, value's illocutionary force. \term{Declarative} structure signals assertion; \term{interrogative} structure signals question; \term{imperative} structure signals command. Mismatch the structure and the force~-- use rising intonation on a declarative to fake a question~-- and you're exploiting the zipper, not breaking it.

This table explains why grammaticality's primarily a syntactician's category. It sits at the morphosyntactic grain~-- the level where form--value couplings are tight, obligatory, and enforced. 

Phoneticians have their own coupling (\term{contrast}), and when it breaks, the response's \mention{what?}, not ungrammaticality. Semanticists have theirs (\term{compositionality}, \term{inference}), and when it breaks, the response's puzzlement or absurdity. Grammaticality's what you feel when the morphosyntactic zipper won't close. That's why syntax owns it.


\section{The gradient at the boundary}
\label{sec:14:gradient}

When we judge a sentence, we aren't checking a rulebook. We're interrogating the \term{standing wave}~-- probing the system to see if the dynamic equilibrium holds or collapses under strain.

A fully grammatical sentence sits at the bottom of a deep basin. Perturb it slightly~-- change word order, shift stress, substitute a near-synonym~-- and the system corrects. An ungrammatical sentence sits outside the basin entirely: no perturbation's going to roll it back to stable ground.

The marginal cases~-- the 3-star and 4-star judgments, the sentences that split informants~-- are poised on the rim. They're at the edge of a phase transition, where small changes in context or construal can tip the system one way or the other.

This reframing has consequences. If grammaticality's basin-stability, then the sharp boundary between well-formed and ill-formed isn't a property of the grammar itself but an artifact of how we test. Gradient judgments aren't noise to be smoothed away; they're signal. The gradient is where the mechanisms are under strain, and strain reveals structure.


\section{Grammaticality as mechanism and category}
\label{sec:14:dual-role}

Grammaticality plays a dual role in the framework. As a \term{category}, it's an HPC~-- the maintained coupling between morphosyntactic form and structural meaning. It passes the diagnostics: it's projectible (one form--value pairing predicts others) and homeostatic (the feeling of ungrammaticality stabilizes the coupling).

As a \term{mechanism}, it's a stabilizer for other HPCs. The category \term{noun}'s maintained partly because nounhood's grammatical~-- because using a word in a noun slot, with noun morphology, in noun constructions, triggers no mismatch signal. Grammaticality's the enforcement mechanism for the form--value couplings that constitute all other categories.

This dual role~-- maintainer and maintained~-- isn't paradoxical. It's characteristic of homeostatic systems. The immune system's both a system (a biological category) and a mechanism that maintains other systems. Grammaticality's the immune system of the grammar.

Or think of the \term{spinning top} metaphor. A top's both an object and the spin that keeps it upright. Remove the spin and the top falls. Grammaticality's the spin. It's both the pattern and the force that maintains it. The top keeps spinning because something keeps pushing.

If grammaticality's a maintained coupling and acceptability's a noisy detector, then the evidential status of the asterisk changes. It's not a report from an oracle but a signal from a measuring instrument~-- informative, but fallible, and calibrated to the community in which it was trained.


\section{Empirical signatures}
\label{sec:14:empirical}

If the feeling of ungrammaticality's a noisy detector~-- not an oracle~-- then laboratory studies should reveal its characteristic failure modes. Three bodies of evidence confirm this prediction.

\subsection{Satiation}

\term{Syntactic satiation}'s the finding that repeated exposure to a marginally acceptable sentence can improve its perceived acceptability \parencite{snyder2000grammaticality}. But the effect's selective. Some constraints are susceptible to frequency-based updating: repeated exposure makes them feel better. Others resist satiation entirely. Left-branch extraction (\ungram\mention{Which did you buy car?}) remains categorically rejected regardless of exposure \parencite{Snyder2022}. The intended meaning's easily grasped~-- \mention{Which car did you buy?}~-- and the structure isn't unusually complex. But the ban persists across tasks, speakers, and presentation modes.

Why the split? If the feeling of ungrammaticality arises from comparing input against entrenched form--value pairings, then repeated exposure should matter~-- but only for constraints that are frequency-sensitive in the first place. When you hear a marginal sentence ten times, you're adding exemplars to the distribution; the pairing becomes more familiar, the mismatch signal weakens, and the sentence feels better. 

But when a constraint's categorical~-- when the form--value pairing's structurally blocked, not just rare~-- no amount of exposure can change that. You can't entrench what isn't licensed. This is entrenchment happening in real time. Satiation experiments don't just show that the feeling's noisy; they show the maintenance mechanism at work. When exposure improves acceptability, we're watching the coupling get reinforced. The feeling tracks the entrenchment, and the entrenchment responds to the input.

\subsection{Individual differences}

Speakers differ systematically in their grammaticality thresholds. The limiting case's trivial: we have no feeling of grammaticality whatsoever for languages we don't speak. A sentence in Zulu or Finnish produces no mismatch signal for me because there's nothing to compare it against~-- no entrenched pairings, no expectations. Foreign language learners occupy the middle ground: their feelings are degraded, unreliable, slow to fire, and easily fooled by surface plausibility. Only with sufficient exposure does the feeling sharpen.

Within a single language community, the variation persists. \textcite{dabrowska2012} shows that grammatical knowledge isn't uniform across the adult population: speakers with less formal education, less exposure to complex syntactic constructions, and less metalinguistic training produce reliably different acceptability judgments~-- not just noise, but systematic divergence.

That's the prediction from community-indexed entrenchment. If grammaticality's what a community's entrenched, then members with different exposure histories will have different thresholds. The variation isn't random; it tracks social and educational ecologies. The \enquote{grammar}'s not a Platonic object that speakers approximate; it's a statistical regularity that speakers instantiate to varying degrees.

\subsection{Processing difficulty and beyond}

Processing difficulty isn't grammaticality, but the two are often conflated. \textcite{phillips2011grammatical} show that comprehension exhibits \term{selective fallibility}: it's exquisitely sensitive to some constraints and systematically vulnerable to others. The pattern reveals something about the architecture of the feeling, not just noise.

Consider \term{garden-path sentences}. When readers encounter a grammatical sentence that's initially misparsed, they produce high unacceptability ratings at the point of reanalysis, even though the sentence's well-formed. The feeling of ungrammaticality fires because processing cost correlates, in normal use, with form--value mismatch. 

The illusion's systematic: it follows from the design of a system optimized for rapid, good-enough processing, not from a failure of the grammar itself. These three signatures~-- satiation, individual differences, and processing-based illusions~-- converge on the same conclusion. The feeling of ungrammaticality's noisy, not oracular. It tracks the coupling between form and value, but it does so imperfectly, shaped by exposure and processing constraints. The asterisk's informative, but it's not infallible.


\subsection{Relevance and the immune system}
\label{sec:14:relevance}

\textcite{scottphillips2024communication} offers a complementary account. On his view, grammaticality intuitions are byproducts of relevance-tracking: we detect when utterances violate basic presumptions about communicative efficiency, just as we detect when visual stimuli violate assumptions about physical objects. Unacceptability arises not from mere inefficiency, but from an inherent impossibility of interpreting an utterance consistently with those presumptions.

The MMMG framework shares several premises with this account. Both reject the need for an innate grammar faculty; both locate intuitions within general cognitive systems; both recognize that communicative pressures shape linguistic conventions. The frameworks differ in their explanatory mechanisms. Where relevance theory predicts that ungrammaticality arises from inferential impossibility, MMMG locates it in the mismatch between morphosyntactic form and structural meaning~-- the zipper that won't close.

The difference has empirical consequences. MMMG predicts that ungrammaticality'll be construction-specific: \ungram\mention{I have twenty years} fails as an age statement because the English age construction's \mention{be} + \mention{years old}, not because relevance-seeking fails. Scott-Phillips's account predicts more general inferential failure. Both approaches agree that the feeling's noisy; they disagree about what it's tracking.

The accounts may ultimately converge. If efficient interpretation requires stable form--meaning pairings, then relevance-tracking and form--value coupling are two descriptions of the same constraint. What MMMG adds is granularity: it identifies the specific level (morphosyntax) and the specific mechanism (entrenchment) that make the coupling possible.


\section{The HPC audit}
\label{sec:14:hpc-audit}

Chapter~\ref{ch:failure-modes} introduced the Two-Diagnostic Test for genuine HPC kinds: high projectibility and robust homeostasis. Grammaticality passes both.

First, consider \term{projectibility}. Learning that one form--value pairing's grammatical lets you predict that similar pairings will be. If \mention{the dog bit \emph{him}}'s grammatical, then \mention{the cat scratched \emph{her}} will be too. This isn't because speakers have memorized every possible sentence; it's because they've abstracted the construction and project its properties to novel instances. Grammaticality's projectible because the form--value coupling's systematic.

Second, \term{homeostasis}. The feeling of ungrammaticality stabilizes the coupling, correcting deviations. Speakers hesitate, repair, rephrase. Hearers ask for clarification, or offer corrections. These micro-interactions are the immune response~-- the mechanism that pushes the system back toward stable couplings when it drifts. Grammaticality's homeostatic because the feeling's a stabilizer.

Grammaticality isn't merely a binary switch, nor a primitive of the theory. It's an HPC kind in its own right~-- maintained by the same mechanisms that maintain countability, definiteness, gender, and lexical categories. It passes the tests. It earns its category status.


\bigskip
\noindent\textsc{Definiteness thread.} This chapter adds the final filter to the definiteness diagnosis: the morphosyntactic \enquote{zipper} rejection of infelicitous forms. The coupling between semantic definiteness and morphosyntactic deitality isn't just a preference; it's a grammatical requirement.
\ea[]{\label{ex:14:definiteness-thread}
\ungram\mention{a the book}}
\z
The immune response that rejects this determiner stacking is the same one that rejects \ungram\mention{I have twenty years} for age.
\textit{Scoped prediction.} This chapter predicts in any population where a novel determiner sequence becomes entrenched (e.g., \mention{all the both}), the ungrammaticality feeling will take exactly three generations to sharpen into a categorical ban on the previous pattern.
\textit{Falsifier.} The prediction would be falsified if we found a language where semantic definiteness remains stable but NO morphosyntactic mismatch signal ever develops for \enquote{illegal} determiner combinations.


\section{Looking forward}
\label{sec:14:looking-forward}

We began with an asterisk. We end with a question about what the asterisk is probing.

Grammaticality's not a primitive. It's not a direct readout of structure. It's not a line in the sand between possible and impossible. It's a maintained coupling~-- form and value, zipper teeth that mesh or don't~-- and the feeling that signals a mismatch is noisy, shaped by what a community's entrenched.

This reframing has consequences. If grammaticality's a category, then we can ask: how projectible is it? how robust is its homeostasis? And if grammaticality's a mechanism~-- the immune system of the grammar~-- then we can ask: what maintains it? what degrades it? what illusions does it produce?

The dual role~-- maintainer and maintained~-- isn't paradoxical. It's characteristic of homeostatic systems. The spinning top is both the object and the spin that keeps it upright. Grammaticality is the spin.

What this means for how we do linguistics~-- for evidence, for argumentation, for the rhetoric of theoretical debate~-- is the subject of the final chapter. The asterisk is a probe into the standing wave. Chapter~\ref{ch:what-changes} asks what happens when we take that probe seriously.
