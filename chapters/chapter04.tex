\chapter{Kinds without essences}
\label{ch:kinds-without-essences}

\epigraph{You should consider that the essential art of civilization is maintenance.}{Pete Seeger, quoted in \citet{brand2024}}

Part I raised a question: if categories aren't defined by essences, what makes them real? The answer this chapter develops is simple: categories are real because they are maintained. This is the \term{maintenance view}.

The word \enquote{maintenance} is chosen deliberately. Stewart Brand's recent work on infrastructure, buildings, and software makes a point that applies equally to grammar: maintenance isn't just preventing breakdown; it's the whole process of keeping something going \citep{brand2024}. Monitoring, repair, renewal, adaptation~-- these are what keep bridges standing and cities functioning. Brand's insight is that we systematically undervalue maintenance because its successes are invisible: a well-maintained system just \emph{works}, and we notice only when it fails.

Grammatical categories are like this. When they function smoothly~-- when speakers agree on what counts as a noun, when learners acquire the same categories their parents have~-- the maintenance is invisible. We notice the mechanisms only at the boundaries, where the system creaks: the words that won't classify, the constructions that shift between generations, the gradience that essentialism can't explain. Brand's framing helps: think of the mechanisms not as defining the categories but as maintaining them. The categories are real because the maintenance is continuous.

The idea of maintenance as constitutive~-- not just preservative~-- comes from philosophy of biology. Species aren't defined by genetic essences~-- no checklist of necessary and sufficient conditions separates one species from another. But species are real. They support induction, figure in explanations, persist across time. What makes them real is not a shared essence but a shared causal history: mechanisms of reproduction, selection, and development that keep certain properties clustering together.

Richard Boyd called these \term{homeostatic property cluster kinds}~-- or HPC kinds \citep{boyd1991,boyd1999}. The name is a mouthful, but the idea is intuitive. A property cluster is homeostatic when mechanisms tend to restore it: disturb the cluster and it returns to form. Species are like this. Perturb the genome and selection pushes back. Isolate a population and reproductive barriers emerge. The clustering isn't accidental. It's maintained.
