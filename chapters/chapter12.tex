\section{The puzzle}
\label{sec:12:hook}
%--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Consider two sentences about the same dog:

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:dog-it}\mention{The dog wagged its tail.}}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:dog-who}\mention{Who's a good boy? Yes, you are!}}
\z
In (\ref{ex:12:dog-it}), the dog takes the non-personal pronoun \mention{it}. In (\ref{ex:12:dog-who}), addressed directly by its owner, the same animal takes the personal interrogative pro-form \mention{who} and receives \mention{you}. Nothing about the dog has changed. What changed is how the speaker construed the referent.

This is the puzzle of English gender. Traditional accounts describe a three-way distinction~-- masculine, feminine, neuter~-- realized mainly on pronouns (\mention{he}, \mention{she}, \mention{it}). That description captures something, but it misses the organizing principle. The primary distinction in English gender isn't sex. It's personhood.

The term \term{gender} in linguistics denotes a system of grammatically relevant contrasts wherein certain semantic concepts are divided into a small number of categories. English gender is typically described as referential rather than noun-class: there's no arbitrary assignment to nouns (unlike German \mention{der Tisch}, \mention{die Lampe}), and the choice of pronoun tracks properties of the referent, not grammatical properties of the antecedent \autocite{corbett1991,huddleston2002}. That much is right. But the usual account keeps the scope narrow~-- \mention{he}/\mention{she}/\mention{it}~-- when the system is far wider.

\textcite{siemund2008} models dialectal variation in English pronominal gender as different thresholds on an individuation hierarchy; \textcite{audring2009} shows how pronominal systems resemanticize when agreement is borne primarily by pronouns; \textcite{dolberg2019} traces the transition from lexical to referential gender in the \textit{Anglo-Saxon Chronicle}. These accounts share a common architecture: English gender is referential, hierarchically organized, and driven by properties of the designatum rather than the antecedent. What they also share is a common limitation: they keep the system's scope largely within third-person pronouns.

This chapter shows why that restriction is too narrow. The same personhood-based logic that governs \mention{he}/\mention{she}/\mention{it} also governs \mention{who}/\mention{which}, \mention{somebody}/\mention{something}, and \mention{when}/\mention{where}. The system extends across the entire semantic class of pro-forms~-- items that take their meaning from another element in discourse. This claim requires defense, since these items belong to different lexical categories. I'll address that question after laying out the evidence.

I'll argue that English gender, like countability (Chapter~\ref{ch:countability}) and definiteness (Chapter~\ref{ch:definiteness-and-deitality}), exhibits the HPC architecture: two clusters~-- one semantic (personhood), one lexico-grammatical (the pro-form inventory)~-- coupled by designatum-driven inference and maintained by overlapping mechanisms. Violations aren't just semantic infelicities; they're grammatical errors. The system has teeth~-- though not all teeth are equally sharp. Some constraints are categorical in standard written English (the \mention{who}/\mention{which} split; core \mention{he}/\mention{she}/\mention{it} uses); others show the graded edge behaviour typical of HPC kinds (compound determinatives under shifted construals; chain-coherence effects). The interest lies in explaining both the categorical core and the gradient periphery.

The puzzle shows up equally clearly in relative pronouns. Consider:


\ea[]{\label{ex:12:doctor-who}\mention{The doctor who I saw was helpful.}}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:doctor-which}\ungram{\mention{The doctor which I saw was helpful.}}}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:book-which}\mention{The book which I read was helpful.}}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:book-who}\ungram{\mention{The book who I read was helpful.}}}
\z

The constraint is robust in standard written English. \mention{Who} for persons, pro-form \mention{which} for non-persons. (\mention{Which person} is fine~-- it's the pro-form use that's restricted.) The violations in (\ref{ex:12:doctor-which}) and (\ref{ex:12:book-who}) aren't merely odd~-- they're ungrammatical, comparable to agreement errors or subcategorization violations.\footnote{The categorical/graded distinction matters for the HPC analysis. Categorical constraints (\mention{who}/\mention{which} in the standard system) define the cluster's core; graded constraints (chain coherence, determinative compounds) define its periphery. Both are explained by the same mechanisms operating with different strength.}

The same split appears in interrogatives:

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:int-who}\mention{Who's coming to the party?} \hfill [asking about persons]}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:int-what}\mention{What's in your purse?} \hfill [asking about non-persons]}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:int-who-bad}\ungram{\mention{Who's in your purse?}} \hfill [under construal: asking about objects]}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:int-what-bad}\ungram{\mention{What's coming to the party?}} \hfill [under construal: asking about persons]}
\z
Examples (\ref{ex:12:int-who-bad}) and (\ref{ex:12:int-what-bad}) are grammatical only under shifted construals~-- if the speaker expects a person in the purse or a non-person attending the party. The choice of interrogative reveals the speaker's conceptualization of the potential referent.

This is the \mention{who}/\mention{which} puzzle. Relative pronouns are not usually discussed under the heading of ``gender,''\footnote{Both \textcite{huddleston2002} and \textcite{quirk1985} treat the personal/non-personal distinction as a separate axis from the \mention{he}/\mention{she}/\mention{it} sex-based contrast. Most grammars fail to recognize the 
distinction at all.} but their distribution obeys exactly the same personhood-based constraint that governs \mention{he}/\mention{she}/\mention{it}. The puzzle dissolves when we recognize that both are manifestations of a single hierarchical system.

\section{The hierarchy}
\label{sec:12:hierarchy}
%--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

The English pro-form gender system is hierarchically organized. At the top level, the distinction is between \term{personal} and \term{non-personal}. Within personal, there's a further split between \term{epicene} (unmarked for sex) and \term{sexual} (masculine/feminine). Within non-personal, productive subtypes include \term{locative} and \term{temporal}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[
  level distance=1.2cm,
  sibling distance=3.5cm,
  every node/.style={font=\small\scshape},
  edge from parent/.style={draw, thick},
  level 1/.style={sibling distance=5cm},
  level 2/.style={sibling distance=2.2cm},
  level 3/.style={sibling distance=1.8cm}
]
\node {pro-form gender}
  child {node {non-personal}
    child {node {general}}
    child {node {temporal}}
    child {node {locative}}
  }
  child {node {personal}
    child {node {epicene}}
    child {node {sexual}
      child {node {masculine}}
      child {node {feminine}}
    }
  };
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Hierarchy of gender values for English pro-forms.}
\label{fig:12:hierarchy}
\end{figure}

Each subtype inherits the properties of its parent. A word with feminine gender is necessarily sexual, which is necessarily personal. A word with locative gender is necessarily non-personal.

Table~\ref{tab:12:inventory} shows the inventory. The leftmost column lists gender-neutral pro-forms~-- items that impose no presuppositional constraint on the designatum. The remaining columns list gender-sensitive items, distinguished by the personhood constraint they encode.

\end{table}

Several entries require comment. Plural \mention{they} is gender-neutral: it can refer to persons (\mention{There are some people. They are tall}) or non-persons (\mention{There are some trees. They are tall}) without constraint. Singular \mention{they}, however, is personal: \mention{There's a person. They are tall} is grammatical, but \mention{*There's a tree. They are tall} is not, in the intended coreferential reading \autocite{bjorkman2017,konnellycowper2020}. The difference is that singular \mention{they} presupposes a personal designatum; plural \mention{they} does not.

Similarly, relative \mention{whose} is compatible with both personal and non-personal antecedents (\mention{the person/book whose story is well known}), while interrogative \mention{whose} typically presupposes a personal possessor (\mention{Whose coat is this?}). The split reflects how these items function: relative \mention{whose} inherits its construal from the antecedent; interrogative \mention{whose} presupposes personhood independently. Non-personal uses of interrogative \mention{whose} do occur with inalienable possession (\mention{Whose leaves are these?}, asking about a tree) or when personification is contextually available, but the default is personal.

I include first- and second-person pronouns (\mention{I}, \mention{we}, \mention{you}) to show the inventory's personhood partition. These are epicene personal: they can only refer to entities construed as persons (using \mention{I} for an inanimate object requires personification), but they don't encode sexual gender. Nothing in the analysis turns on sex marking for these items.

The table reveals a system far larger than the traditional \mention{he}/\mention{she}/\mention{it} triad. The compound determinatives~-- \mention{somebody}/\mention{something}, \mention{everyone}/\mention{everything}, \mention{anywhere}/\mention{anyone}~-- participate in the same personhood partition. The relative pro-forms \mention{where} and \mention{when} encode non-personal subtypes parallel to \mention{which}.

\section{Designatum-driven gender}
\label{sec:12:designatum}
%--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Before examining the mechanism, a clarification. The English system tracks the \term{designatum}~-- the entity as conceptualized by the speaker~-- not the referent (the real-world correlate) or the antecedent (the linguistic controller). The \term{designatum} is what a linguistic term designates; the \term{referent} is ``some independently distinguishable entity, or set of entities, in the real world'' \autocite[399]{huddleston2002}. The \term{antecedent} is the ``constituent whose meaning dictates the meaning of a pronoun or other such expression in cases of anaphora'' \autocite[295]{huddleston2005}.

This distinction is crucial. A pro-form need not have an antecedent to participate in the gender system: interrogative \mention{who} introduces an open slot whose intended value is constrained to persons even though the utterance has neither a referent nor an antecedent. The designatum need not be a token: \mention{the typical politician is not to be trusted} designates a type, but the gender is still personal. And the designatum can diverge from the antecedent's lexical properties.

The English system differs from antecedent-driven systems in exactly this way. In Spanish, French, or German, gender assignment is fixed on nouns and agreement spreads through NP-internal morphology. The antecedent controls the pro-form.

In English, it's the designatum~-- how the referent is conceptualized~-- that controls selection. The source provides the constraint; the pro-form satisfies it.

Consider a case of referential metonymy:

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:metonymy}\mention{The French fries is waiting. She's upset.} \hfill \autocite{wu2025}}
\z
An NP with a default non-personal reading (\mention{the French fries}) is used to invoke a customer; subsequent anaphora tracks that metonymic designatum, yielding personal-feminine \mention{she}. The antecedent's form (plural, non-personal) doesn't control the pro-form; the conceptualized source does.

Spanish is much less permissive about this kind of pro-form shift while retaining ordinary agreement with the same antecedent NP. (The English number mismatch~-- plural label, singular verb~-- reflects a menu-item construal orthogonal to the pro-form point; in Spanish I keep agreement normal to isolate the controller issue.)

\ea\label{ex:12:spanish}
    \ea[{}]{\mmark{\gll \mention{Las} \mention{patatas} \mention{fritas} \mention{esperan}. \mention{Él} \mention{está} \mention{enfadado}.\\
    \textsc{def.f.pl} potato.\textsc{f.pl} fried.\textsc{f.pl} wait.\textsc{3pl.pres} \textsc{3sg.m} be.\textsc{3sg.pres} angry.\textsc{m.sg}\\
    \glt Intended: `The French fries are waiting. He's upset.' [fails under intended coreference]}}
    \ex[]{\gll \mention{Las} \mention{patatas} \mention{fritas} \mention{esperan}. \mention{El} \mention{señor} \mention{está} \mention{enfadado}.\\
    \textsc{def.f.pl} potato.\textsc{f.pl} fried.\textsc{f.pl} wait.\textsc{3pl.pres} \textsc{def.m.sg} gentleman.\textsc{m.sg} be.\textsc{3sg.pres} angry.\textsc{m.sg}\\
    \glt `The French fries are waiting. The gentleman is upset.'}
    \z
\z
Spanish requires grammatical agreement with the antecedent (\textit{patatas}, feminine plural), not semantic agreement with the metonymic designatum. The speaker typically recasts the controller with a human-denoting NP like \mention{\textit{el señor}} (`the gentleman') to achieve the intended reference. English permits categorical shifts based on conceptualization because it lacks NP-internal gender agreement: the designatum-driven pathway is freer. This is the signature of a designatum-driven system.

\section{The inventory}
\label{sec:12:inventory}
%--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Standard accounts keep gender within personal pronouns. \textcite[486]{huddleston2002} state that English gender is ``based purely on pronoun agreement.'' But the evidence shows the system extends across all pro-forms~-- the semantic class of items that take their meaning from another element in discourse.

What unifies pro-forms is their interpretive dependence: they have minimal
descriptive content and take their value from context~-- linguistic,
situational, or conceptual. In the clearest cases, a pronoun heads an NP
whose referent is recoverable from the discourse or situation; pro-forms like
\mention{here}/\mention{there}/\mention{then} likewise contribute a place or
time that is supplied by context rather than descriptively specified. In
interrogatives and relatives, \mention{wh}-forms do not ``stand for'' a missing
phrase so much as mark an open slot in the clause's interpretation, linked to
an answer (in questions) or to an antecedent (in relatives). This isn't a
morphosyntactic category (there's no frame that selects for ``any pro-form''),
but a semantic--pragmatic one. The gender constraint doesn't respect lexical-category
boundaries: whatever property licenses \mention{who} also licenses \mention{somebody}
and blocks \mention{something}.

Recall the skink in the epigraph: first \mention{one's} (epicene personal, attributing the capacity to learn), then \mention{it} (non-personal, the default for a lizard). The chain shifts from personal to non-personal across clauses~-- exactly the kind of construal shift that §\ref{sec:12:chain-coherence} will show is possible but marked.

\subsection{Determinatives}
\label{sec:12:determinatives}

The compound determinatives with \mention{-body} and \mention{-one} are personal:

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:somebody}\mention{Somebody left their coat.} \hfill [personal]}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:somebody-bad}\ungram{\mention{Somebody is in your purse.}} \hfill [under construal: referring to an object]}
\z
Example (\ref{ex:12:somebody-bad}) is ungrammatical unless \mention{somebody} refers to a person who is in the purse. These are epicene~-- they don't encode sex~-- but they do encode the personal/non-personal distinction.

The compound determinatives with \mention{-thing} and \mention{-where} are non-personal:

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:something}\mention{Something is on the table.} \hfill [non-personal]}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:something-bad}\ungram{\mention{Everything enjoyed themselves.}} \hfill [under construal: personal referents]}
\z
Example (\ref{ex:12:something-bad}) requires personification to be grammatical. The boundary is discourse-driven rather than syntactically hard~-- exactly the HPC-style graded edge we expect.

\subsection{Relative pro-forms}
\label{sec:12:relative-proforms}

The distinction between \mention{where}/\mention{when} and \mention{which} parallels the distinction between \mention{who} and \mention{which}:

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:room-where}\mention{the room where the painting was done} \hfill [room as location]}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:room-which}\mention{the room which was painted} \hfill [room as patient]}
\z

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:2010-when}\mention{2010, when I left} \hfill [as time]}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:2010-which}\mention{2010, which has 365 days} \hfill [as entity]}
\z
The same source (\mention{room}, \mention{2010}) takes different pro-forms depending on how it's conceptualized. This is designatum-driven selection applied to locative and temporal subtypes.

A note on apparent avoidance. English relative clauses permit \mention{that} (a subordinator functioning as marker) and bare relatives without any overt relativizer: \mention{the doctor that I saw}, \mention{the doctor I saw}. These aren't gender-neutral pro-forms~-- they're structurally different constructions that happen to sidestep the \mention{who}/\mention{which} choice. Their availability doesn't undermine the gender system; it simply means speakers can use a different construction when they want to avoid committing to a personhood construal. The existence of the escape route is itself evidence that the marked options carry construal weight.

\section{How the system holds together}
\label{sec:12:coupling}
%--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

\subsection{Chain coherence}
\label{sec:12:chain-coherence}

Once a designatum is construed as personal or non-personal within a reference chain, mixing is disfavoured. Consider:

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:dog-chain-a}\mention{That's the dog who attacked his owner.} \hfill [personal chain]}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:dog-chain-b}\mention{That's the dog which attacked its owner.} \hfill [non-personal chain]}
\z
\ea[{}]{\label{ex:12:dog-chain-c}\mmark{\mention{That's the dog which attacked his owner.}} \hfill [mixed]}
\z
\ea[{}]{\label{ex:12:dog-chain-d}\mmark{\mention{That's the dog who attacked its owner.}} \hfill [mixed]}
\z
Examples (\ref{ex:12:dog-chain-a}) and (\ref{ex:12:dog-chain-b}) are fully acceptable~-- coherent personal and non-personal chains. Examples (\ref{ex:12:dog-chain-c}) and (\ref{ex:12:dog-chain-d}) are degraded~-- the chain starts in one gender and shifts to another mid-sentence.

This is \term{chain-internal coherence}. The constraint isn't absolute~-- discourse can independently reclassify a designatum (personification, stance shift)~-- but absent such cues, speakers prefer consistency within a reference chain. The contrast is strongest when the speaker is not deliberately shifting stance.

Chain coherence is a maintenance mechanism. It stabilizes the personhood assignment across discourse, reinforcing the clustering of pro-forms around a shared construal.

\subsection{The coupling}
\label{sec:12:coupling-subsec}

We now have the architecture. On the semantic side sits the \term{personhood cluster}: the conceptual properties that make a referent construable as a person. These cluster because personhood is a natural cognitive category, grounded in Theory of Mind and social cognition \autocite{waytz2010}.

Person-attribution, as I use it, tracks a cluster of features: potential for reciprocal interaction, nameability, attribution of intentions, membership in the speaker's circle of concern. \textcite{dennett1976} lists formal conditions for personhood (rationality, consciousness, reciprocal treatment, self-awareness); I use these illustratively, not as necessary conditions that speakers compute. What matters is that these features cluster~-- Theory of Mind operates on them as a package~-- and that the clustering is cognitively basic and socially consequential.

Two kinds of personhood construal should be distinguished. In most cases, personhood is a \term{default construal}: \mention{the doctor} evokes a person without the speaker doing anything special. In others, personhood is \term{locally imposed}: \mention{Who's a good boy?} addressed to a dog requires active construal work. The maintenance story tracks both. Defaults are entrenched through ordinary usage; local impositions require discourse cues and carry interactional meaning (affection, stance, humour). The system accommodates both because the coupling is bidirectional: form can signal construal, and construal can license form.

On the lexico-grammatical side sits the \term{pro-form inventory}: the gender-sensitive lexical items and their distributional constraints~-- the personal pronouns (\mention{he}/\mention{she}/\mention{it}/\mention{they}), the pro-nominal \mention{one}, \mention{who}/\mention{which} in relative clauses, \mention{-body}/\mention{-thing} in compound determinatives, and designated slots for personal and non-personal reference. (Pro-form is a semantic grouping; what I'm tracking here is its \emph{realization}~-- the specific forms and where they're licensed.)

The two clusters are coupled by \term{designatum-driven inference}. When speakers produce a pro-form, they signal how they're construing the referent. When hearers process a pro-form, they infer the construal. The inference runs bidirectionally: form cues construal; construal constrains form.

This parallels the bidirectional inference that couples individuation to count morphosyntax (Chapter~\ref{ch:countability}) and identifiability to deitality (Chapter~\ref{ch:definiteness-and-deitality}). The coupling is what produces the HPC signature: properties that statistically co-occur, maintained by causal mechanisms, with graded membership at the edges.

\subsection{The machinery of maintenance}
\label{sec:12:maintenance}

Chapter~\ref{ch:stabilizers} surveyed the general machinery that maintains linguistic kinds: acquisition, entrenchment, alignment, transmission. For pro-form gender, these mechanisms operate through three domain-specific channels.

\term{Cognitive grounding} explains why acquisition succeeds. The person/non-person boundary isn't learned from distributional patterns alone; it's mapped onto a pre-existing conceptual distinction. Personhood attribution is cognitively basic~-- grounded in Theory of Mind, face processing, and social cognition \autocite{waytz2010,carey2009}. Infants distinguish agents from non-agents within months of birth; by 12 months they attribute goals to entities that act contingently \autocite{csibra2003}. Because the conceptual cluster is already in place, children don't have to induce it from pro-form distributions~-- they just have to learn which forms map onto which region of an existing landscape. This is why acquisition of English pro-form gender is fast and robust: the hard work was done before language began.

\term{Semantic transparency} explains why transmission preserves the coupling. The mapping from personhood to pro-form is largely predictable: if you know a referent is construed as a person, you can predict the pro-form inventory it will take. Compare French gender, where assignment is arbitrary and must be learned item by item, or English countability, where object-mass nouns like \mention{furniture} create opaque exceptions. English pro-form gender has fewer such mismatches: the \mention{who}/\mention{which} alternation tracks personhood with high fidelity. This transparency means the system can be reconstructed from limited input~-- what Chapter~\ref{ch:stabilizers} called \term{learnability filtering}. Children acquiring English don't produce the persistent paradigmatic gender-agreement errors characteristic of grammatical-gender languages, though direct acquisition studies of the \mention{who}/\mention{which} contrast specifically remain sparse.

\term{Alignment and repair} explains why the coupling is enforced in real time. Consider a constructed repair:

\begin{quote}
A: \mention{The new doctor started today. It seems competent.}\\
B: \mention{\emph{She} seems competent. Dr. Patel, you mean?}
\end{quote}

\noindent The correction is immediate, unmarked, and socially meaningful. Gender mismatches are charged in a way that many grammatical errors aren't: calling a person \mention{it} is an insult; misgendering someone with \mention{he} when \mention{she} is appropriate triggers conversational repair \autocite{mcconnell-ginet2014}. This repair pressure operates through what Chapter~\ref{ch:stabilizers} called \term{interactive alignment}: interlocutors converge on shared construals, and deviations are corrected. The social stakes amplify the mechanism~-- gender isn't just about communication; it's about recognition.

These three channels~-- cognitive grounding, semantic transparency, alignment and repair~-- don't replace the general mechanisms; they specify how those mechanisms operate in this domain. The stability of pro-form gender emerges from their convergence: the conceptual cluster is pre-linguistic, the form-meaning mapping is reconstructible, and violations are repaired in real time.

\subsection{What the HPC framing buys}
\label{sec:12:hpc-payoff}

A sceptical reader might ask: why invoke HPC machinery at all? Why not say that each pro-form simply carries its own selectional presupposition~-- \mention{who} presupposes a personal referent, \mention{which} presupposes a non-personal one~-- and leave it there? Item-by-item presuppositions are simpler than coupled clusters.

The answer is that item-by-item presuppositions don't explain the system's behaviour. Three phenomena require more than local selectional restrictions.

First, \term{bidirectional inference}. If pro-forms merely carried presuppositions, hearers would use form to filter referent candidates~-- ruling out non-persons for \mention{who}, ruling out persons for \mention{which}. But the inference also runs the other way: hearers use \mention{who} to \emph{attribute} personal construal, even when the referent is non-human. \mention{The dog who bit me} doesn't just filter for dogs already construed as persons; it \emph{invites} that construal. This is coupling, not selection.

Second, \term{chain coherence}. If gender were just local presupposition, mixed chains (\mention{who... it}) should be as acceptable as any other presupposition shift within discourse. They aren't. The dispreference for mixed chains is a \emph{system-level} constraint~-- it tracks construal stability across the chain, not just satisfaction of local presuppositions. That's the signature of a maintained coupling, not a collection of independent filters.

Third, \term{graded boundaries tracking the same dimension}. The boundary cases~-- pets, collectives, infants, robots~-- don't scatter randomly. They cluster along the personhood dimension. If each pro-form had independent presuppositional content, we would expect idiosyncratic variation: \mention{who} might extend to animals, \mention{somebody} might not. Instead, the entire inventory shifts together when personhood is uncertain. That's what coupled clusters do.

The HPC framing doesn't add complexity for its own sake. It explains why the system behaves as a system: why inference is bidirectional, why chains cohere, why boundaries track a shared dimension. Item-by-item presuppositions would predict a looser, more heterogeneous pattern~-- exactly what we don't see.

\subsection{The maintenance spectrum}
\label{sec:12:maintenance-spectrum}

Gender systems differ not just in their inventories but in \emph{what maintains them}. The contrast between English and French illustrates the extremes; German sits between \autocite{corbett1991,audring2009}.

English pro-form gender is \term{designatum-driven}: the form tracks how the speaker construes the referent. The metonymy example in §\ref{sec:12:designatum} showed this~-- \mention{the French fries... she} is possible because the pro-form follows the conceptualized customer, not the grammatical antecedent. The system is maintained by a live semantic link: form and meaning travel together because the coupling is transparent.

French gender is \term{antecedent-driven}: the pro-form tracks the grammatical gender of the antecedent NP, regardless of the referent's properties. The same metonymy fails:

\ea[{}]{\label{ex:12:french-fries}\mmark{\gll \mention{Les} \mention{frites} \mention{attendent}. \mention{Il} \mention{est} \mention{en} \mention{colère}.\\
\textsc{def.f.pl} fry.\textsc{f.pl} wait.\textsc{3pl.pres} \textsc{3sg.m} be.\textsc{3sg.pres} in anger\\
\glt Intended: `The fries are waiting. He's upset.' [fails under intended coreference]}}
\z

\noindent The speaker cannot use masculine \mention{il} to track a male customer if the antecedent \mention{les frites} is grammatically feminine. The form-meaning link is dead: French gender is maintained by \term{pure entrenchment}~-- item-by-item memorization of arbitrary noun-class assignments, reinforced by NP-internal concord.

German is the hybrid. Nouns carry grammatical gender (\mention{der Tisch} `the table', masculine; \mention{die Lampe} `the lamp', feminine; \mention{das Mädchen} `the girl', neuter). But pronouns can override the antecedent's grammatical gender when the referent's natural gender is salient:

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:german-girl}\gll \mention{Das} \mention{Mädchen} \mention{kam} \mention{herein}. \mention{Sie} \mention{lächelte}.\\
\textsc{def.n} girl.\textsc{n} came in. \textsc{3sg.f} smiled.\\
\glt `The girl came in. She smiled.'}
\z

\noindent The antecedent \mention{das Mädchen} is grammatically neuter, but the pronoun \mention{sie} is feminine~-- tracking the referent's natural gender, not the noun's grammatical class. German gender is maintained by \emph{two mechanisms in tension}: entrenchment of noun-class assignment, and semantic override in pronominal anaphora.

This is the \term{maintenance spectrum}. At one end, English: semantically transparent, designatum-driven, thin clustering held together by a live conceptual distinction. At the other end, French: semantically arbitrary, antecedent-driven, thick clustering held together by morphological entrenchment. German sits in between, with the two mechanisms competing.

The HPC framework predicts different profiles for these systems. English gender should be easy to acquire (transparent mapping) but potentially unstable under pressure (no formal redundancy). French gender should be hard to acquire (arbitrary assignment) but stable once learned (reinforced by concord). German should show characteristic acquisition errors where the two systems conflict (which it does: children often produce natural-gender pronouns for grammatical-neuter human nouns). The ``same'' category~-- grammatical gender~-- has different ontological status depending on what maintains it.

\subsection{Cross-linguistic scope}
\label{sec:12:cross-linguistic}

Is pro-form gender an English peculiarity or a cross-linguistic pattern?

The personhood distinction appears remarkably widespread. \textcite{haspelmath1997} notes that ``the distinction between human and non-human referents is made practically everywhere (`who' vs.\ `what', `somebody' vs.\ `something'), even in languages where humanness isn't very prominent elsewhere in the grammar'' (34--35). Languages with rich antecedent-driven gender (Spanish \mention{quién}/\mention{qué}, German \mention{wer}/\mention{was}, French \mention{qui}/\mention{quoi}) still make the personhood split in their interrogative and indefinite systems \autocite{corbett1991,dahl2000}. The personhood partition may be cognitively more basic than the particular morphosyntactic systems that realize it.

What's distinctive about English isn't the personhood distinction itself but its \term{scope}. Because English lacks NP-internal gender agreement, the designatum-driven pathway is unconstrained by formal concord. Speakers can shift a referent's construal without generating agreement violations. The \mention{who}/\mention{which} alternation, the \mention{-body}/\mention{-thing} compounds, and the chain-coherence effects are all more prominent in English precisely because they're not overridden by noun-class agreement.

Dialectal variation within English shows the system's parameters. \textcite{siemund2008} documents varieties (Southwest England, Newfoundland, Tasmania) where the personal/non-personal cut shifts: \mention{he} and \mention{she} extend to inanimates based on a mass/count distinction rather than personhood. The hierarchy's structure remains stable; its semantic basis varies. This suggests the architecture is robust but its semantic grounding is a parameter that communities can tune.

\subsection{Passing the tests}
\label{sec:12:tests}

Chapter~\ref{ch:failure-modes} introduced the Two-Diagnostic Test for genuine HPC kinds: high projectibility and robust homeostasis.

Knowing a pro-form's gender predicts its distribution. If you know \mention{somebody} is personal, you can predict it will combine with personal predicates, take personal reflexives (\mention{themselves}), and resist non-personal contexts. If you know \mention{which} is non-personal, you can predict it cannot take human antecedents without personification.

Crucially, knowing the designatum's construal predicts pro-form selection. If you know the speaker is construing a pet as personal, you can predict \mention{who} over \mention{which}, \mention{he}/\mention{she} over \mention{it}. The predictions are bidirectional: from form to construal, from construal to form.

The clustering is maintained by mechanisms. Acquisition transmits the system as a unit; entrenchment preserves high-frequency patterns; alignment provides real-time stabilization; transmission filters for learnability. Perturb any mechanism~-- expose children to non-standard input, isolate speakers from conversational feedback~-- and the cluster should degrade. But it doesn't scatter randomly; the degradation should track the mechanisms involved.

The clustering isn't just a statistical regularity. It's causally maintained.

\subsection{Where the clusters slip}
\label{sec:12:slippage}

By ``slippage'' I mean cases where the two clusters that normally travel together~-- personhood construal and the pro-form inventory that encodes it~-- are pulled apart by independent pressures. The result is not random noise: the same boundary cases recur, and the same repairs and preferences reassert the coupling. The interest of these cases is diagnostic: they show which mechanisms are doing the stabilizing, and where other systems~-- number, specificity, register~-- interfere with the personhood signal.

\subsubsection{Boundary designata}

Some referents sit at the boundary of personhood attribution. Pets are the paradigm case. \textcite{shirvertesh2012} demonstrates that pet-keeping licenses flexible personhood construal: the same animal can be a person in one context and not in another. This flexibility surfaces in pro-form choice:

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:cat-it}\mention{The cat licked its paw.} \hfill [non-personal default]}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:cat-she}\mention{Poor Whiskers! She's not feeling well.} \hfill [personal]}
\z
Same referent, different construals~-- and different pro-forms. The variability here is not a partial breakdown of the coupling; it's the \emph{expected} outcome when the semantic cluster itself is gradient. Because personhood is genuinely uncertain for these referents, the system permits controlled alternation. What stabilizes the pattern is chain coherence: having chosen personal or non-personal for a given referent in a given discourse, speakers prefer to stay consistent.

\subsubsection{Interference from number}

Collective nouns present a case where another grammatical cluster~-- number and mereology~-- interferes with the personhood signal:

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:team-its}\mention{The team has scored its first goal.} \hfill [singular, non-personal]}
\z
\ea[]{\label{ex:12:team-their}\mention{The team have scored their first goal.} \hfill [plural, personal]}
\z
The variation tracks construal: team-as-entity versus team-as-members. But this is primarily notional versus grammatical number, not gender per se. The personhood of the individual members is not in doubt; what varies is whether they're accessed as individuals or aggregated into a single non-personal entity.

Dialect and register norms amplify the variation. British English more readily accepts plural verb agreement with singular collective heads; American English more strongly prefers singular.\footnote{Bock et al.\ provide experimental and corpus evidence on BrE/AmE divergence in collective agreement.} What's interesting for the HPC analysis is that the combination of singular verb with plural personal anaphora (\mention{The team has changed their strategy}) is widely tolerated~-- the two agreement systems (verbal, pronominal) can diverge when pulled by different pressures. The mechanism that stabilizes the pattern is standardisation pressure: edited prose tends to favour singular--singular or plural--plural; informal speech permits the mix.

\subsubsection{Competition from other pressures}

Human infants, paradigmatic persons, can take non-personal \mention{it}:

\ea[]{\label{ex:12:baby-it}\mention{The baby was crying because it was hungry.}}
\z
This is not a denial of personhood. It reflects competition between personhood and other communicative pressures~-- particularly sex-marking and specificity. When the infant's sex is unknown or irrelevant, \mention{it} can avoid the sex-based \mention{he}/\mention{she} alternation. In generic construals (\mention{A baby needs its mother}), the kind-level reading aligns naturally with non-personal anaphora. And in some contexts, as \textcite{mcconnell-ginet2014} notes, the choice of \mention{it} can carry ideological weight~-- positioning the infant as not-yet-fully-a-person, though this is not the default reading.

The slippage here is diagnostic: it shows that the personhood--pro-form coupling can be loosened when other communicative goals take priority. What stabilizes the pattern is semantic transparency: when a speaker does construe an infant as personal, the system snaps back to \mention{he}/\mention{she}/\mention{they}.

\subsubsection{Lexeme-specific anchoring}

Not all non-personal pro-forms behave identically when chains continue. Relative \mention{which}, tethered to an antecedent NP, appears more permissive for some speakers in allowing later personal anaphora, even though the resulting mixed chain is typically marked:

\ea[{}]{\label{ex:12:which-chain}\mmark{\mention{The dog which attacked the woman ran away. The police never caught him.}} \hfill [upgrade within chain]}
\z
The antecedent (\mention{the dog}) supplies enough information~-- animacy, individuality~-- that hearers can reconstruct a personal designatum and accommodate the shift.

But \mention{what} in free relatives and \mention{something} are systematically underspecified. They lack a full NP antecedent to inherit features from, so there is less material for hearers to anchor a promoted personal construal:

\ea[{}]{\label{ex:12:what-chain}\mmmark{\mention{What attacked the woman ran away. The police never caught him.}}}
\z
\ea[{}]{\label{ex:12:something-chain}\mmmark{\mention{Something attacked the woman. The police never caught him.}} \hfill [with coreference]}
\z
The contrast, if these judgments hold up, is not simple gradience within the non-personal domain; it's a difference in discourse anchoring and feature support. Relative \mention{which} points to an existing NP whose descriptive content can sometimes license an \enquote{upgrade}; \mention{what} and \mention{something} provide no comparable antecedent to inherit from, so the chain more strongly resists promotion to personal. The mechanism that stabilizes the pattern is chain coherence: when the anchor is weak, shift is blocked or sharply degraded.

\section{Looking forward}
\label{sec:12:transition}
%--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Pro-form gender is a localized system. The relevant constraints are carried by a specific semantic class of lexical items~-- those that function as pro-forms~-- and enforced across anaphoric chains. The coupling between personhood and morphosyntax is tight within that domain.

The final case study pushes to the widest scope. Lexical categories like \term{noun} and \term{verb} look strikingly stable cross-linguistically, while \term{adjective} and \term{adposition} vary dramatically. If these are HPC kinds, the mechanisms that maintain them must be far more diffuse~-- operating across the entire grammar, not just within a circumscribed inventory. Chapter~\ref{ch:lexical-categories} asks what happens when the coupling is weak, the mechanisms are partial, and the cluster boundaries are contested.
