Subject: A parallel Parallel Architecture

Dear Professor Jackendoff,

I am writing to share a draft of my book manuscript, *Words That Won't Hold Still: How Linguistic Categories Work*, which argues for a "maintenance view" of linguistic theory that I believe is deeply aligned with your work on the Parallel Architecture.

Although we have not met, your work on architectural realism and the constraints on the language faculty has been central to the development of the framework I propose here. The core argument of the book is that linguistic categories (from phonemes to constructions) are "homeostatic property clusters" (HPCs)—real kinds maintained by identifiable mechanisms rather than by essential definitions.

I have tried to make explicit the connections to the Parallel Architecture throughout the manuscript, specifically:

*   **Chapter 1 ("The Problem"):** Frames the failure of classical definitionism as an architectural issue, citing your work on the poverty of the stimulus and the need for interface constraints.
*   **Chapter 3 ("The Nominalist Challenge"):** Discusses your position alongside Haspelmath and Croft, arguing that the PA provides the necessary realist guardrails against pure nominalism.
*   **Chapter 4 ("The Mechanism"):** Details how the "maintenance view" implements the interface constraints you have long argued for.
*   **Chapters 10 & 11 (Lexical Categories):** Uses PA's relational view of syntactic categories to explain why "noun" and "verb" stabilize cross-linguistically while "adjective" varies.
*   **Chapter 14 ("Phenomenology"):** Draws on your work on the phenomenology of language (specifically the Balance/Vision analogies) to model the "what it's like" of grammaticality.

I am particularly hoping that the argument in **Chapter 15 ("Implications")** regarding the "zipper" metaphor for interface coupling might resonate with your view of how independent components (phonology, syntax, semantics) align without being derivational.

The attached draft is for review only. I would be incredibly grateful for any thoughts you might have, particularly on whether I have characterized the Parallel Architecture's role in this landscape correctly.

Sincerely,

Brett Reynolds
