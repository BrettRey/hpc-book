**Subject:** Re: A parallel Parallel Architecture

Dear Ray,

Thank you for taking the time to read and for engaging so substantively. It means a great deal.

Your point about essentialism as cognitive default is one I'll need to sit with. The gestalt psychologists are a useful touchstone - and the approach/flee/mate framing puts the adaptive pressure in sharp focus. I suspect we're circling the same phenomenon from different angles: cognition that treats categories as more uniform than they are, because that approximation usually pays off. Whether to call that "essentialist" may be partly terminological, but there's something real underneath that I want to get right.

On *The Texture of the Lexicon*: I have it and admire it. Your approach - starting from partial similarities, with full productivity as the extreme case - is deeply compatible with what I'm trying to do. The "texture" metaphor itself captures something the maintenance view needs: not uniform fabric, but varying density of support. Your note prompts me to make the connection more explicit in the manuscript.

I know Peter from various conferences and will follow up with him directly. *Syntactic Nuts* is already in the bibliography - "perfectly stable but decidedly offbeat" is exactly the kind of pattern the framework is meant to explain.

I hope you find time to read further. The case studies in Part III are where the framework earns its keep - or fails to.

With thanks,

Brett
