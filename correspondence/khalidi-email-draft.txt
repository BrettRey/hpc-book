Subject: A précis on linguistic categories as natural kinds

Dear Muhammad,

I hope this finds you well and that you're enjoying the holidays.

I've been working on a book applying natural-kinds theory to linguistic categories, and your work has been central to how I'm thinking about the project. The book argues that grammatical categories are homeostatic property clusters maintained by mechanisms like acquisition, entrenchment, and iterated transmission—what you'd call "copied kinds" in your 2015 framework.

I've attached a précis (~4,500 words) that outlines the argument. The core theoretical contribution is what I'm calling "field-relative projectibility": the claim that projectibility is indexed to analytical purpose, so that semantics and syntax may have genuinely different HPCs with overlapping extension. I'm curious whether this is a genuine refinement of natural-kinds theory or whether it's already implicit in something like your causal-networks account.

If you have time to look at it, I'd welcome any feedback—particularly on whether the application to linguistics faces objections I haven't anticipated. If it would be useful, I'm also happy to send the drafted chapters (Parts I and II are complete in prose).

No rush at all—I know this is a busy time of year.

Best,
Brett
